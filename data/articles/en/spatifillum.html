            <p>The peace lily should be transplanted once a year in spring, when the roots fill the pot. Use a general-purpose soil mix or an aroid mix that is well-draining and loose. Transplanting promotes healthy growth and blooming.</p>
            <p>When transplanting, it's important to ensure good drainage to avoid water stagnation. Place a layer of expanded clay or coarse sand at the bottom of the pot.</p>
            <p>After transplanting, the plant may experience stress, so it's best to place it in a shaded area for a few days and slightly moisten the soil.</p>

            <p>The peace lily loves moisture, but it should only be watered after the top layer of soil has dried out. It's better to use the "touch" method to control the moisture level. Watering should be regular but not excessive.</p>
            <p>In winter, the frequency of watering can be reduced, but it's important to avoid the soil drying out. You can increase humidity by misting or placing the plant on a tray with wet expanded clay.</p>
            <p>Use soft, room-temperature water to avoid salt buildup in the soil.</p>

            <p>Feed the plant with complex mineral fertilizers or special fertilizers for flowering plants every two weeks during the growing season (from spring to autumn).</p>
            <p>In winter, you can skip fertilizing or reduce the frequency to once a month. Over-fertilizing can lead to root burns and deteriorating plant health.</p>

            <p>Darkening of leaf edges may be related to overwatering or a lack of nutrients. If the leaves start yellowing, it could indicate a lack of light or nutrients.</p>
            <p>To improve the plant's condition, check its growing conditions: lighting, watering frequency, and soil quality. Regularly wipe the leaves to remove dust and improve photosynthesis.</p>
