            <p>Begonia requires periodic transplantation. If its roots are showing through the drainage holes, it's time for a new pot. Choose a ceramic pot of larger volume, 3-4 cm wider in diameter than the previous one. A too-large pot can cause soil overwatering. After transplantation, place the plant back in its original spot. Water more frequently initially. Young begonias are easy to transplant. Before the age of 3, it is advisable to divide them before transplanting.</p>

            <p>Proper watering is the main challenge in caring for begonias. They love moisture, but overwatering quickly leads to root rot. Drying out is also harmful, so maintaining optimal soil moisture is essential.</p>
            <p>Watering frequency depends on the season:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Summer - Abundant watering 2–4 times a week; during heatwaves, water daily but gradually.</li>
                <li>October - Reduce watering based on soil dryness.</li>
                <li>Winter - Minimize watering to once a week if humidity is above 60% and temperature is around 18°C.</li>
                <li>March - Gradually increase watering frequency and intensity.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Water should be warm and well-settled. If your tap water contains a lot of lime, it can alkalize the soil. Occasionally adding a few drops of citric acid to the water is recommended.</p>
            <p>The best time to water begonias is in the morning. During warm periods, you can water them in the evening, but not during midday heat.</p>

            <p>It is best to use special liquid fertilizers for begonias as they have a balanced composition suitable for this plant. Fertilizers for ornamental foliage and flowering houseplants are also suitable.</p>
            <p>Fertilizers high in nitrogen are only suitable for foliage begonias, as they promote leaf growth. Flowering begonias need phosphorus and potassium-rich formulas. For flowering begonias, especially Elatior, you can use long-acting fertilizers like tablets or sticks.</p>

            <p>Improper care can lead to a decline in the plant's health and appearance. Common problems include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Brown edges on leaves that fall off indicate insufficient watering and excessively dry air.</li>
                <li>Pale leaves suggest a lack of light.</li>
                <li>Fungal growth indicates excess moisture and low temperature. Remove affected parts and treat the plant with fungicides.</li>
                <li>Dry air and temperature fluctuations can cause powdery mildew, which appears as white spots on leaves. Treat with a 1% colloidal sulfur solution.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Common pests include aphids and spider mites, which usually settle on the underside of leaves. Spider mites thrive in dry air and heat. Use soapy water with tobacco extract to get rid of them. Aphids can be controlled with pyrethrum-based solutions.</p>
