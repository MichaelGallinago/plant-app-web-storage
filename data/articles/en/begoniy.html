            <p>Begonia requires periodic transplantation. If its roots are showing through the drainage holes, it's time for a new pot. Choose a ceramic pot of larger volume, 3-4 cm wider in diameter than the previous one. A too-large pot can cause soil overwatering. After transplantation, place the plant back in its original spot. Water more frequently initially. Young begonias are easy to transplant. Before the age of 3, it is advisable to divide them before transplanting.</p>

            <p>Proper watering is the main challenge in caring for begonias. They love moisture, but overwatering quickly leads to root rot. Drying out is also harmful, so maintaining optimal soil moisture is essential.</p>
            <p>Watering frequency depends on the season:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Summer - Abundant watering 2–4 times a week; during heatwaves, water daily but gradually.</li>
                <li>October - Reduce watering based on soil dryness.</li>
                <li>Winter - Minimize watering to once a week if humidity is above 60% and temperature is around 18°C.</li>
                <li>March - Gradually increase watering frequency and intensity.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Water should be warm and well-settled. If your tap water contains a lot of lime, it can alkalize the soil. Occasionally adding a few drops of citric acid to the water is recommended.</p>
            <p>The best time to water begonias is in the morning. During warm periods, you can water them in the evening, but not during midday heat.</p>

            <summary><h2>Spraying Begonia</h2></summary>
            <img src="https://static.mk.ru/upload/entities/2021/03/23/15/articlesImages/image/09/f1/18/0d/aee0406147453d05a0998dc787659560.jpg" alt="Spraying">
            <p>Begonias have specific requirements for spraying that are important to understand for successful cultivation.</p>
            <p><b>Important considerations for spraying begonias:</b></p>
            <p>1. Humidity needs: Begonias are native to tropical and subtropical regions where humidity levels are naturally high. They thrive in environments with 50-70% humidity, making regular spraying beneficial in most indoor settings.</p>
            <p>2. Leaf sensitivity: Many begonia varieties, especially those with fuzzy or hairy leaves (like Rex begonias), should not have water sprayed directly on their foliage. Water droplets can cause spotting, fungal issues, and leaf damage when they remain on the leaves.</p>
            <p>3. Variety-specific needs: Different begonia types have different spraying requirements:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fibrous and tuberous begonias with smooth leaves can tolerate light misting</li>
                <li>Rex and rhizomatous begonias with textured leaves should avoid direct leaf spraying</li>
                <li>Cane-type begonias (angel wing) can benefit from occasional misting in dry conditions</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Recommended spraying practices:</b></p>
            <p>• For smooth-leaved varieties: Mist the air around the plant rather than directly on the foliage, using room temperature, soft water (distilled or filtered). Morning spraying is best to allow leaves to dry during the day.</p>
            <p>• Frequency: During growing season (spring and summer), mist around smooth-leaved begonias 2-3 times per week. In winter, reduce to once weekly or less depending on indoor humidity levels.</p>
            <p>• Water quality: Always use soft, room-temperature water free of chlorine and minerals that can leave deposits on leaves.</p>
            <p><b>Alternative humidity methods for begonias:</b></p>
            <p>• Humidity trays: Place the pot on a tray filled with pebbles and water (ensuring the pot doesn't sit directly in water)</p>
            <p>• Grouping plants: Place begonias near other plants to create a more humid microclimate</p>
            <p>• Room humidifier: Use an electric humidifier near begonias, especially during winter when heating systems reduce indoor humidity</p>
            <p>• Bathroom placement: For varieties that tolerate lower light, bathrooms with windows can provide naturally higher humidity</p>
            <p>The optimal spraying interval for most begonias is approximately every 2-3 days during active growth periods, but only for varieties with smooth leaves and only by misting around the plant rather than directly on the foliage. For fuzzy or hairy-leaved varieties, focus on alternative humidity methods instead of direct spraying.</p>
            <p>Note: If you notice any signs of powdery mildew, leaf spots, or other fungal issues, immediately stop spraying and improve air circulation around the plant. Treat any fungal problems promptly with appropriate fungicides specifically safe for begonias.</p>

            <img src="https://cdn.garshinka.ru/styles/article_full_image/public/fields/2023/begonia1.jpg" alt="Fertilization">
            <p>It is best to use special liquid fertilizers for begonias as they have a balanced composition suitable for this plant. Fertilizers for ornamental foliage and flowering houseplants are also suitable.</p>
            <p>Fertilizers high in nitrogen are only suitable for foliage begonias, as they promote leaf growth. Flowering begonias need phosphorus and potassium-rich formulas. For flowering begonias, especially Elatior, you can use long-acting fertilizers like tablets or sticks.</p>

            <p>Improper care can lead to a decline in the plant's health and appearance. Common problems include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Brown edges on leaves that fall off indicate insufficient watering and excessively dry air.</li>
                <li>Pale leaves suggest a lack of light.</li>
                <li>Fungal growth indicates excess moisture and low temperature. Remove affected parts and treat the plant with fungicides.</li>
                <li>Dry air and temperature fluctuations can cause powdery mildew, which appears as white spots on leaves. Treat with a 1% colloidal sulfur solution.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Common pests include aphids and spider mites, which usually settle on the underside of leaves. Spider mites thrive in dry air and heat. Use soapy water with tobacco extract to get rid of them. Aphids can be controlled with pyrethrum-based solutions.</p>

            <p>Begonia purifies and disinfects the air in the room where it is placed. Its leaves are rich in phytoncides that destroy harmful microorganisms. The presence of begonias improves human resistance to diseases, relieves fatigue, boosts productivity, and stimulates mental activity.</p>
            <p>Begonias are recommended not only for home decoration but also for office spaces. They absorb harmful toxins from the air. Additionally, begonia is used in traditional medicine for pain relief, wound healing, and as an anti-inflammatory remedy.</p>
