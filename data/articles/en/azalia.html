            <p>To transplant an azalea, follow these steps:</p>
            <p>1. Prepare a new pot and soil. The pot should be slightly larger than the previous one, providing enough space for root growth. Azaleas prefer acidic, well-drained soil rich in organic matter. You can buy special azalea soil or prepare it yourself by mixing peat and sand.</p>
            <p>2. Choose the right time for transplanting. The best time is spring or autumn when the plant is dormant and better withstands transplant stress. Avoid transplanting during hot summer months when the azalea is actively growing and flowering.</p>
            <p>3. Water the plant well. Then gently remove the azalea from the old pot, being careful not to damage the roots. Inspect the roots for rot or disease and remove any damaged or diseased parts.</p>
            <p>4. Place the azalea in the new pot, fill it with prepared soil, and gently compact the soil around the roots.</p>
            <p>5. After transplanting, water the plant well and place it in a shaded spot to recover from the stress.</p>

            <p>During especially hot days, water the plant daily, sometimes even twice a day if the soil dries out quickly. During winter, water azalea very rarely, about once a week, if kept at a temperature of up to 8°C. During spring and autumn, watering depends on bud formation and flowering periods.</p>

            <summary><h2>Spraying Azalea</h2></summary>
            <a href='https://postimg.cc/LnjGBp3M' target='_blank'><img src='https://i.postimg.cc/QxzsDNBV/pexels-sanka-zejnelhoxha-262057475-12671545.jpg' border='0' alt='Spraying Azalea'/></a>
            <p>Azaleas are native to humid woodland environments and benefit greatly from regular spraying to maintain optimal health and flowering.</p>
            <p><b>Importance of spraying for azaleas:</b></p>
            <p>1. Humidity requirements: Azaleas thrive in environments with high humidity (50-70%). Regular spraying helps maintain these levels, especially in dry indoor conditions with central heating or air conditioning.</p>
            <p>2. Pest prevention: Adequate humidity through spraying helps prevent spider mites and other pests that prefer dry conditions. These pests can quickly damage azalea foliage if left unchecked.</p>
            <p>3. Dust removal: Regular spraying keeps the leaves clean from dust, allowing for better photosynthesis and overall plant health.</p>
            <p><b>Recommended spraying routine:</b></p>
            <p>• Frequency: During the growing season and flowering period, spray azalea daily or every other day. In winter, reduce to 2-3 times per week, but don't stop completely as indoor heating systems can create very dry conditions.</p>
            <p>• Water quality: Use only soft, room-temperature water (rainwater, filtered, or distilled). Azaleas are sensitive to lime and chlorine in tap water, which can damage leaves and alter soil pH over time.</p>
            <p>• Timing: Morning spraying is best as it allows leaves to dry during the day, reducing the risk of fungal diseases. Avoid evening spraying when temperatures drop.</p>
            <p>• Technique: Create a fine mist around and over the plant. During flowering, avoid spraying directly on the blooms as water droplets can cause spotting and reduce flower lifespan.</p>
            <p><b>Additional humidity methods for azaleas:</b></p>
            <p>• Humidity tray: Place the pot on a tray filled with pebbles and water, ensuring the pot doesn't sit directly in water.</p>
            <p>• Grouping plants: Place your azalea near other plants that enjoy high humidity to create a beneficial microclimate.</p>
            <p>• Humidifier: In particularly dry environments, use an electric humidifier near the plant, especially during winter months.</p>
            <p>• Bathroom placement: If there's adequate light, azaleas can benefit from the naturally higher humidity in bathrooms.</p>
            <p>The optimal spraying interval for azaleas is every 1-2 days during active growth and flowering periods, and every 2-3 days during dormancy. During extremely hot and dry periods, daily spraying may be necessary.</p>
            <p>Note: If you notice any signs of fungal disease (such as powdery mildew or leaf spots), temporarily reduce spraying frequency and ensure good air circulation around the plant. Treat any fungal issues promptly with appropriate fungicides specifically safe for azaleas.</p>

            <p>It is best to fertilize azalea with mineral fertilizers rich in potassium or phosphorus. Be cautious, as fertilizers containing chlorine can harm the plant.</p>
            <p>Recommended fertilizers include "Uniflor-Bud" or "Kemira-Lux". Special mineral fertilizers from the "Azalea" series also work well.</p>
            <p>Fertilizing is often needed during spring and summer—sometimes as frequently as weekly.</p>

            <p><b>Common Azalea Diseases and Treatments:</b></p>
            <p>1. Gray Rot. Caused by poor care and improper watering. To treat, remove all rotten parts, dry the soil, and treat the plant and soil with fungicides free of chlorine and lime.</p>
            <p>2. Root Rot. Usually appears due to excessive watering and stagnant water in the pot or tray. Leaves wilt throughout the plant, shoots become weak and may droop. To save the azalea, remove affected roots, soak the root system in potassium permanganate or a fungicide solution, then replant in new soil.</p>
            <p>3. Phytophthora. A dangerous disease that is not always curable. First signs include brown spots with a light border on leaves. Over time, they grow, parts of the plant start dying. To treat, remove affected parts, treat the plant with fungicides, and replant in new soil.</p>

            <p><b>Some interesting facts about azaleas:</b></p>
            <p>1. Over 150 years of selective breeding have produced approximately 12,000 different azalea varieties, and the number continues to grow.</p>
            <p>2. Azaleas are hardy plants that grow and bloom even in the Himalayas.</p>
            <p>3. With proper care, azaleas can live for decades, even up to 50 years.</p>
