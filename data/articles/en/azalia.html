            <p>To transplant an azalea, follow these steps:</p>
            <p>1. Prepare a new pot and soil. The pot should be slightly larger than the previous one, providing enough space for root growth. Azaleas prefer acidic, well-drained soil rich in organic matter. You can buy special azalea soil or prepare it yourself by mixing peat and sand.</p>
            <p>2. Choose the right time for transplanting. The best time is spring or autumn when the plant is dormant and better withstands transplant stress. Avoid transplanting during hot summer months when the azalea is actively growing and flowering.</p>
            <p>3. Water the plant well. Then gently remove the azalea from the old pot, being careful not to damage the roots. Inspect the roots for rot or disease and remove any damaged or diseased parts.</p>
            <p>4. Place the azalea in the new pot, fill it with prepared soil, and gently compact the soil around the roots.</p>
            <p>5. After transplanting, water the plant well and place it in a shaded spot to recover from the stress.</p>

            <p>During especially hot days, water the plant daily, sometimes even twice a day if the soil dries out quickly. During winter, water azalea very rarely, about once a week, if kept at a temperature of up to 8°C. During spring and autumn, watering depends on bud formation and flowering periods.</p>

            <p>It is best to fertilize azalea with mineral fertilizers rich in potassium or phosphorus. Be cautious, as fertilizers containing chlorine can harm the plant.</p>
            <p>Recommended fertilizers include "Uniflor-Bud" or "Kemira-Lux". Special mineral fertilizers from the "Azalea" series also work well.</p>
            <p>Fertilizing is often needed during spring and summer—sometimes as frequently as weekly.</p>

            <p><b>Common Azalea Diseases and Treatments:</b></p>
            <p>1. Gray Rot. Caused by poor care and improper watering. To treat, remove all rotten parts, dry the soil, and treat the plant and soil with fungicides free of chlorine and lime.</p>
            <p>2. Root Rot. Usually appears due to excessive watering and stagnant water in the pot or tray. Leaves wilt throughout the plant, shoots become weak and may droop. To save the azalea, remove affected roots, soak the root system in potassium permanganate or a fungicide solution, then replant in new soil.</p>
            <p>3. Phytophthora. A dangerous disease that is not always curable. First signs include brown spots with a light border on leaves. Over time, they grow, parts of the plant start dying. To treat, remove affected parts, treat the plant with fungicides, and replant in new soil.</p>

            <p><b>Some interesting facts about azaleas:</b></p>
            <p>1. Over 150 years of selective breeding have produced approximately 12,000 different azalea varieties, and the number continues to grow.</p>
            <p>2. Azaleas are hardy plants that grow and bloom even in the Himalayas.</p>
            <p>3. With proper care, azaleas can live for decades, even up to 50 years.</p>
