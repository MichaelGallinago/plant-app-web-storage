            <p>When should this orchid be transplanted? It is done if it has been growing in the same soil mixture and container for 2 or 3 years. Over time, the soil mixture becomes compacted and acidic, making it unsuitable for growing, so the substrate needs to be replaced. Another reason for transplanting is when the root system becomes very branched and grows through the drainage holes. This procedure should be done after the plant has finished blooming.</p>
            <p>If the Phalaenopsis is healthy and grown in a coarse substrate, it should be carefully transferred to a larger new pot with a good drainage layer at the bottom. Fill the gaps in the pot with new substrate, which should contain medium and small-sized bark, and also add sphagnum. A ready-made substrate for orchids can be bought, or you can make it yourself by placing a good drainage layer at the bottom of the container using small pieces of foam or expanded clay, then adding medium-sized bark and mixing it with chopped sphagnum. Keep in mind that dry bark allows water to pass through quickly, so before preparing the substrate, the bark should be thoroughly washed and then soaked in water for 2 days to allow it to swell. After this, rinse the bark again with clean water.</p>

            <p>The orchid should only be watered after the substrate has completely dried, but it should not remain dry for an extended period. When growing the plant in a transparent pot, the disappearance of moisture from the walls is a signal to water. If the plant lacks water, the color of the green roots will become paler. For opaque pots, you will need to dig into the substrate to check how dry it is. When watering, avoid getting water on the leaves; water should be poured directly into the substrate, or you can use bottom watering by immersing the pot in a container of water, allowing the substrate to absorb moisture through the drainage holes.</p>
            <p>The watering water should be soft and clean. It should be filtered and then boiled. Distilled water can also be used. Once every 4 weeks, the plant should be given a shower, or it can be rinsed under a tap. Afterward, the plant should be dried well. Do not overwater the orchid, as its leaves will begin to wilt, and the risk of root rot increases. This could lead to the growth of side shoots, but in the worst case, it could kill the plant.</p>

            </summary>
            <p>Fertilize the plant during watering by adding a complete complex fertilizer (Kemira Lux) to the water (1 gram per liter of water). Fertilize every two weeks. It is also possible to fertilize once a week, but in this case, the nutrient solution should be more diluted. Always fertilize the plant after watering.</p>

            <p><b>Main diseases and their treatment:</b></p>

            <p>Fusarium: This is a fungal disease caused by excess moisture. The plant cannot be cured and should be burned. Other types of rot should be treated with a fungicide, with two applications at 1.5-week intervals.</p>
            <p>Large spots on leaves: Reduce watering, move the plant to a warmer place, and ventilate the room more often.</p>
            <p>Leaf drying: Transplant the plant to a more comfortable environment.</p>
            <p>Leaves stretching: Move the plant closer to the light.</p>

            <p><b>Pests and their treatment:</b></p>

            <p>Thrips: Treat with an insecticide.</p>
            <p>Spider mite: Wash with soapy water, spray with "Anti-mite".</p>
            <p>Mealybug: Wash with soapy water, treat with insecticides.</p>
            <p>Scale insects: Treat with insecticides and wash with soapy water.</p>
            <p>Slugs: Attract with carrot or cucumber and remove, or treat with insecticides.</p>

            <p>1. Do not overwater the plant, as this can lead to various diseases.</p>
            <p>2. The root system should be exposed to air and needs light.</p>
            <p>3. The plant also has aerial roots, which branch out and search for nutrients. Keep an eye on them to ensure they don't end up in a nearby flowerpot.</p>
            <p>4. The plant blooms twice a year (in spring and autumn), but with very good care, it may bloom 3 times in one year.</p>
