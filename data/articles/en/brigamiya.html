            <p><b>For transplanting Brighamia, the following steps are recommended:</b></p>
            <p>1. Prepare the materials: you will need a new pot, fresh soil, gloves, and pruning shears. Tools should
                be wiped clean to prevent the spread of diseases.</p>
            <p>2. Gently remove the plant from the current pot: to do this, loosen the soil around the edges of the pot,
                turn the container sideways, and carefully pull the plant out. Be mindful of the roots and avoid any
                sudden movements to prevent damaging them.</p>
            <p>3. Inspect the roots: trim any dead, damaged, or excessively long roots using sterilized pruning shears. If
                the roots are tightly interwoven, gently separate them.</p>
            <p>4. Add a layer of fresh soil to the bottom of the new pot: place the plant in the center and fill the space
                around it with the soil mixture, ensuring the plant is at the same depth as in the old pot.</p>
            <p>5. Gently compact the soil around the roots. If necessary, add more soil, leaving about 2 cm from the
                edge of the pot for watering.</p>
            <p>6. Lightly water the plant. Place it in a location with bright, diffused light and maintain optimal
                temperature conditions.</p>
            <p>7. Observe the plant for the next few weeks, watering moderately until it roots. Avoid fertilizing right after
                transplanting; wait about a month before resuming the regular fertilizing schedule.</p>
            <p>
            <pre> </pre>
            </p>
            <p>Young plants should be transplanted every year, while adult plants need it once every 2–3 years. The best time
                for transplanting is in the spring.</p>

                 alt="Watering Brighamia">
            <p>Brighamia should be watered moderately, allowing the soil to dry completely in the container.</p>
            <p>In summer, water the plant once a week, and in winter, once every 30 days.</p>
            <p>The water for watering should be slightly warmer than room temperature and should be soft. Avoid overwatering,
                as this can cause the roots to rot and deteriorate.</p>

            <p>For active growth from spring to autumn, use fertilizers for succulents once a month. This will provide the
                Brighamia with the necessary nutrients for healthy growth and blooming.</p>

            <p><b>Some diseases and pests of Brighamia and their solutions:</b></p>
            <p>• Root rot: occurs due to excessive moisture in the substrate. To solve this problem, reduce watering and ensure
                good drainage of the soil.</p>
            <p>• Yellowing and deformation of leaves, appearance of a transparent cobweb on the remaining leaves and stem -
                signs of spider mite infestation. To solve this issue, increase the room humidity to 50–60%. You can also treat
                the plant with a soapy solution (dissolve 30g of grated laundry soap in 1 liter of water, let it steep for
                several hours, and strain). If the measures don't help, use the biopesticide "Bona Forte" or insecticides like
                "Actellic" or "Aktara".</p>
            <p>• Leaf loss: this may result from excess moisture in the substrate, drafts, or insufficient light. To solve the
                problem, adjust the conditions for the plant and identify the mistake. Then, the Brighamia will regrow new
                green leaves.</p>

            <pre> </pre>
            </p>
            <p>Also, when buds appear and during flowering, do not move the plant from one place to another, as it will drop all
                its buds and flowers.</p>
