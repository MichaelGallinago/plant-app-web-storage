            <p><b>For transplanting Brighamia, the following steps are recommended:</b></p>
            <p>1. Prepare the materials: you will need a new pot, fresh soil, gloves, and pruning shears. Tools should
                be wiped clean to prevent the spread of diseases.</p>
            <p>2. Gently remove the plant from the current pot: to do this, loosen the soil around the edges of the pot,
                turn the container sideways, and carefully pull the plant out. Be mindful of the roots and avoid any
                sudden movements to prevent damaging them.</p>
            <p>3. Inspect the roots: trim any dead, damaged, or excessively long roots using sterilized pruning shears. If
                the roots are tightly interwoven, gently separate them.</p>
            <p>4. Add a layer of fresh soil to the bottom of the new pot: place the plant in the center and fill the space
                around it with the soil mixture, ensuring the plant is at the same depth as in the old pot.</p>
            <p>5. Gently compact the soil around the roots. If necessary, add more soil, leaving about 2 cm from the
                edge of the pot for watering.</p>
            <p>6. Lightly water the plant. Place it in a location with bright, diffused light and maintain optimal
                temperature conditions.</p>
            <p>7. Observe the plant for the next few weeks, watering moderately until it roots. Avoid fertilizing right after
                transplanting; wait about a month before resuming the regular fertilizing schedule.</p>
            <p>
            <pre> </pre>
            </p>
            <p>Young plants should be transplanted every year, while adult plants need it once every 2–3 years. The best time
                for transplanting is in the spring.</p>

                 alt="Watering Brighamia">
            <p>Brighamia should be watered moderately, allowing the soil to dry completely in the container.</p>
            <p>In summer, water the plant once a week, and in winter, once every 30 days.</p>
            <p>The water for watering should be slightly warmer than room temperature and should be soft. Avoid overwatering,
                as this can cause the roots to rot and deteriorate.</p>

                <h2>Spraying Brighamia</h2>
            </summary>
            <img src="https://fluxai.pro/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffal.media%2Ffiles%2Fmonkey%2FG9Kel-Dd3XlvOBb57pCE1_image.webp&w=1920&q=75"
                 alt="Spraying Brighamia">
            <p>Brighamia has specific requirements for spraying that reflect its native habitat and succulent-like characteristics.</p>
            <p><b>Important information about spraying Brighamia:</b></p>
            <p>1. Limited spraying needs: Brighamia is native to Hawaii and has adapted to survive in relatively dry conditions. Unlike many tropical plants, it does not require frequent spraying or high humidity levels.</p>
            <p>2. Stem and leaf sensitivity: The thick, succulent-like stem and leaves of Brighamia can be susceptible to rot if excess moisture remains on them for extended periods. Direct spraying of the plant should be limited.</p>
            <p>3. Seasonal considerations: During active growth periods (spring and summer), Brighamia may benefit from occasional light misting of the air around it, but not directly on the plant. During dormancy (fall and winter), spraying should be minimal or avoided entirely.</p>
            <p><b>Recommended spraying practices:</b></p>
            <p>• Frequency: During warm months, mist the air around the plant (not directly on it) once every 7-10 days. In winter, reduce or eliminate spraying entirely.</p>
            <p>• Technique: When spraying, hold the mister at least 30-40 cm away from the plant and create a fine mist in the air surrounding it. This increases ambient humidity without wetting the plant directly.</p>
            <p>• Timing: If you do spray, do so in the morning to allow any accidental moisture on the plant to evaporate during the day.</p>
            <p>• Water quality: Use only soft, room-temperature water (filtered, distilled, or rainwater) to avoid mineral deposits on the leaves.</p>
            <p><b>Alternative humidity methods for Brighamia:</b></p>
            <p>• Instead of direct spraying, place the pot on a tray with pebbles and a small amount of water, ensuring the pot doesn't sit directly in the water</p>
            <p>• For cleaning purposes, gently wipe the leaves with a soft, slightly damp cloth once a month to remove dust</p>
            <p>• Maintain good air circulation around the plant to prevent fungal issues</p>
            <p>The optimal spraying interval for Brighamia is approximately once every 7-10 days during the growing season, and only by misting the air around the plant rather than spraying directly on it. During the dormant period, spraying can be reduced to once every 2-3 weeks or eliminated entirely.</p>
            <p>Note: If you notice any signs of stem softening, discoloration, or rot, immediately stop all spraying and allow the plant to dry out. Brighamia is more tolerant of dry conditions than excess moisture.</p>

            <p>For active growth from spring to autumn, use fertilizers for succulents once a month. This will provide the
                Brighamia with the necessary nutrients for healthy growth and blooming.</p>

            <p><b>Some diseases and pests of Brighamia and their solutions:</b></p>
            <p>• Root rot: occurs due to excessive moisture in the substrate. To solve this problem, reduce watering and ensure
                good drainage of the soil.</p>
            <p>• Yellowing and deformation of leaves, appearance of a transparent cobweb on the remaining leaves and stem -
                signs of spider mite infestation. To solve this issue, increase the room humidity to 50–60%. You can also treat
                the plant with a soapy solution (dissolve 30g of grated laundry soap in 1 liter of water, let it steep for
                several hours, and strain). If the measures don't help, use the biopesticide "Bona Forte" or insecticides like
                "Actellic" or "Aktara".</p>
            <p>• Leaf loss: this may result from excess moisture in the substrate, drafts, or insufficient light. To solve the
                problem, adjust the conditions for the plant and identify the mistake. Then, the Brighamia will regrow new
                green leaves.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Also, when buds appear and during flowering, do not move the plant from one place to another, as it will drop all
                its buds and flowers.</p>

            <p><b>Some interesting facts about Brighamia:</b></p>
            <p>1. In its native land, the Hawaiian Islands, Brighamia is considered a medicinal plant that helps with wounds and
                infections.</p>
            <p>2. If the top of the stem is damaged, several buds may wake up, creating the effect of a "lush crown".</p>
            <p>3. A warm shower once every 4 weeks benefits the plant, but the water should not be hot.</p>
            <p>4. The flowers of Brighamia have a light vanilla fragrance.</p>
            <p>5. In its native habitat, Brighamia can reach a height of 5 meters, while indoors it typically grows from 20 cm to
                1 meter.</p>
            <p>6. When the stem or leaves are damaged, a milky sap is released, which can cause skin irritation.</p>
