    <h1>Light for Houseplants</h1>
    <div class="section" id="0">
        <p>Sunlight plays a very important role in the development of plants, but different plants
            prefer different light intensities. Some don't mind basking in direct sunlight, while others
            prefer shade. Some plants love diffused light, while others are fine with just a regular light bulb.</p>
        <p>This article lists the main, widely popular houseplants and their light preferences.</p>

            </summary>
            <p>Aspidistra, aglaonema, gloxinia, sansevieria (mother-in-law's tongue or snake plant). As
                can be seen from the list, there are not many such plants, but this doesn't mean they
                should be placed in dark corners. They feel quite well in partial shade.</p>

                Most decorative foliage and flowering plants prefer such conditions. One of the brightest
                places in the apartment is the windowsill, although the area nearby is also fine. However,
                it is important to remember that at half a meter from the windowsill, the amount of light
                is halved.</p>

            <p>Of course, these are not all the plants, but only those that are most commonly found on
                windowsills or in apartments, both by amateur gardeners and housewives. Sunlight for plants
                is as necessary as air and water, but in moderate amounts. This condition is essential for
                the normal development of each plant species. At the same time, it is important to strictly
                follow the care instructions for plants and create suitable conditions for their normal growth,
                including providing the required amount of light. A plant can feel poorly both from a lack of light
                and from an excess, and the effects of direct sunlight can cause burns. In this case, the result
                can be disastrous, and starting over is always difficult.</p>
