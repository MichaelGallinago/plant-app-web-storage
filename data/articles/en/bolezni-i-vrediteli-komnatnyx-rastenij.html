                <h2>Common Diseases of Houseplants</h2>
            </summary>
            <p>Houseplants are susceptible to various diseases. These diseases are the result of unfavorable environmental conditions, as well as improper care. These can include: excessive humidity or dryness of the air, too high or too low temperatures, lack of fertilization or excess, poor quality of soil mix, inappropriate containers, etc. Most of these diseases do not spread to other plants. Sometimes the problem is that stores sell greenhouse plants, which can be difficult to adapt to the conditions of modern apartments, causing them to poorly develop or shed leaves, indicating that the conditions for this plant are not entirely suitable. If such an incident occurs, the plant should be removed from the pot and the roots examined. If the root system is damaged, the plant will have to be discarded; otherwise, it should be replanted, and the cause determined experimentally. Perhaps the plant needs more light or lacks nutrients. It can be fertilized and moved to a brighter location. If the plant was previously in a bright place, it should be moved to partial shade or full shade.</p>
            <p>In any case, it's essential to check the effectiveness of drainage and whether it's present at all. If absent, the plant should be repotted correctly. Many houseplants cannot tolerate temperature fluctuations or drafts. This is an important factor to consider when caring for houseplants or flowers.</p>
            <p>Dry air, especially in the winter when the heating season begins, can cause significant harm to plants. It can lead to the appearance of thrips and spider mites if preventive measures are not taken.</p>
            <p>Watering plants should be done with room temperature water, and only soft water (rainwater or melted water) that has been settled.</p>

                <h2>Fungi Causing Spots on Leaves</h2>
            </summary>
            <p>Typically, plants that are not well cared for are affected. Mainly, this affects: camellias, anthuriums, some types of palms, and orchids.</p>
            <p>Such damage <strong>is characterized</strong> by the appearance of small spots on the leaves. If no measures are taken, these spots spread, and the leaves begin to die.</p>
            <p><strong>Control methods</strong> involve not spraying the affected plants with water and removing the affected leaves.</p>

                <h2>Anthracnose</h2>
            </summary>
            <p>This common disease can develop in warm and humid conditions, which is typical when growing plants in greenhouses.</p>
            <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> appear as dark brown streaks on the leaves of plants such as palms and ficuses.</p>
            <p><strong>Control methods</strong> for this disease involve systemic treatment of plants with fungicides and removal of damaged leaves. Additionally, watering and spraying of plants are suspended for several weeks.</p>

                <h2>Powdery Mildew</h2>
            </summary>
            <p>This type of disease occurs in dry and warm air. Different fungi can appear on different types of plants. In other words, fungi that appear on begonias may not appear on roses. True powdery mildew affects plants such as hydrangeas, crotons, begonias, kalanchoes, cyclamens, chrysanthemums, roses, and African violets.</p>
            <p><strong>Appearance</strong> of this disease is characterized by a white, easily detachable coating. This coating can be found on the leaves, buds, young shoots, and flowers. Afterward, the affected areas begin to blacken and die. The fungus can quickly spread to other plants of the same species.</p>
            <p><strong>Control methods</strong> involve isolating the infected plant and removing the affected areas, after which the plant is treated with appropriate chemical agents.</p>

                <h2>False Powdery Mildew</h2>
            </summary>
            <p>This fungus thrives in a humid, cold environment. It can affect specific plant species, such as primroses, calceolarias, and gloxinias.</p>
            <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> include the appearance of an indelible white coating on the underside of leaves. <strong>To prevent the appearance of this disease</strong>, the soil and air around the plant should not be over-moisturized. Infected plants should not be sprayed with water, as the fungus lives inside the leaf tissues, making spraying with various preparations ineffective.</p>

                <h2>Black Leg</h2>
            </summary>
            <p>This disease appears in the stem cuttings of many plants, but geraniums are especially susceptible. It can occur due to high humidity or excessive soil compaction, which prevents water from freely passing through.</p>
            <p><strong>Symptom</strong> of this disease is the blackening of the base of the cutting, indicating it has been infected by the Botrytis fungus.</p>
            <p>The affected cutting should be immediately removed and a new one planted, ensuring the soil or substrate is not too moist, and the cutting should not be covered with plastic or glass.</p>

                <h2>Gray Mold</h2>
            </summary>
            <p>The gray mold fungus can appear in wet and warm air conditions due to incorrect placement of the plant, which weakens it. Plants with thin, soft leaves are particularly susceptible to this disease.</p>
            <p><strong>Appearance</strong> of this disease can be detected by the presence of gray mold on the stems and leaves, which can spread into the air if strong drafts occur. The result of such damage may be the darkening and death of the affected areas.</p>
            <p><strong>Control methods</strong> for this disease involve carefully and gently removing the affected areas. Afterward, the plant should not be sprayed, and watering should be reduced. The room should also be ventilated regularly.</p>

                <h2>Rust</h2>
            </summary>
            <p>This disease appears on plants such as roses, fuchsias, geraniums, etc.</p>
            <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> of rust can be identified by the appearance of brown or orange pustules resembling warts, located on the upper side of the leaf. They can be easily lifted with a fingernail, and light spots appear in their place.</p>
            <p>If the plant is infected with rust, it is better to destroy the entire plant rather than just the affected parts. If the plant is very rare and expensive, it can be treated with a systemic fungicide.</p>

                <h2>Stem Rot</h2>
            </summary>
            <p>The appearance of this fungus promotes its rapid spread, leading to the death of the plant. Afterward, the entire plant, along with the pot and soil, is disposed of.</p>
            <p><strong>Appearance</strong> of this disease can be identified by the softening of the stems or the entire crown, followed by rotting and the development of mold.</p>
            <p>To prevent such diseases, it's necessary to avoid over-watering and remove damaged plants quickly.</p>
