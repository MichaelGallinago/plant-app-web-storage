            <p><b>To properly transplant Howea, follow these steps:</b></p>
            <p>1. Prepare the container: If the plant is mature (over 3 years old) and fully adhered to the pot walls, it is recommended to break the pot to minimize root system disturbance. For Howea, tall pots are preferred. The ratio of the plant to the pot should be approximately 2:1.</p>
            <p>2. Tilt the pot and check if the roots are stuck. Trim excess roots with a pruner.</p>
            <p>3. Carefully remove the plant from the pot: Remove the top layer of soil, trying not to damage the roots. If the plant has rotten or dried roots, they should be removed. Treat cut roots with charcoal to help them settle better.</p>
            <p>4. Prepare soil for the plant: Since Howea is a palm, palm substrate is suitable. Sprinkle the substrate on the working surface and loosen it slightly by hand. Add sand to the palm substrate at a ratio of 1 part sand to 3 parts substrate and mix well. Also, add some charcoal to help the plant settle better. To ensure successful rooting, add a little root stimulator to the substrate.</p>
            <p>5. Make a high drainage layer, as Howea does not like stagnant water. Pour about 5 cm of the soil mixture on top of the drainage and compact it well.</p>
            <p>6. Carefully place the plant in the pot. Pour soil around the plant. Do not compact it, as Howea prefers light soil.</p>
            <p>Young Howea plants are transplanted every year, while older ones are transplanted once every 2–3 years. Large potted specimens do not need transplanting, but the top layer of the substrate should be replaced annually.</p>

            <p>During the active growth period from spring to late summer, Howea should be watered about 2–3 times a week with a moderate amount of water. In autumn, watering is reduced to once a week.</p>
            <p>During the winter, the watering regime depends on the conditions in which Howea is kept:</p>
            <p>• On an insulated balcony, watering once every 10 days is sufficient;</p>
            <p>• In a cool, dimly lit room, water twice a month;</p>
            <p>• In an apartment or office, water once a week.</p>
            <p>It is recommended to use room temperature water that is well-settled or filtered.</p>

            <p>For fertilizing Howea, it is recommended to use complex fertilizers for palms with a balanced ratio of essential macronutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium at a ratio of 18-18-18).</p>
            <p>Fertilization should be applied during the active growing season — from spring to autumn (April–August). The optimal scheme is alternating between root feeding and leaf spraying, with a frequency of 1–2 times per month. When applying fertilizers to the leaves, use a solution of low concentration.</p>
            <p><b>Some fertilizers that can be used for Howea:</b></p>
            <p>• "Agricola" — Designed to restore soil, stimulate growth and nutrition, strengthen plant immunity.</p>
            <p>• BONA FORTE for ficuses and palms, "Health" series — Designed to stimulate growth, nutrition, and strengthen plant immunity.</p>
            <p>Read the instructions carefully and follow the dosage guidelines before using fertilizers.</p>
