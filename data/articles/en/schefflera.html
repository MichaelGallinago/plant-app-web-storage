            <p>The following is recommended for transplanting a Shefflera:</p>
            <p>1. Determine if transplanting is necessary. Young plants should be transplanted every year, as they grow actively and quickly fill a small pot with roots. Adult plants need to be transplanted once every two to three years.</p>
            <p>2. Prepare the pot. Fill a larger pot with drainage and fresh soil, so that after planting the roots of the plant do not protrude beyond the new pot.</p>
            <p>3. Gently remove the Shefflera from its old pot, remove excess soil, and transplant it. It is important that the root system has the space to grow in the new pot, so plant the plant on a wide layer of soil, not just on a lightly covered drainage layer.</p>
            <p>4. After transplanting, press the plant tightly so that there are no air pockets in the pot and the roots can make better contact with the soil, and water it abundantly.</p>

                <h2>When to Water Shefflera</h2>

            <p>Water the Shefflera with settled room temperature water according to the following schedule: in summer, 2-3 times a week, in winter, if it is cool (16-18Â°C), once every 10 days.</p>
            <p>Water the plant when the top layer of the soil is dry. The rule is: it is better to let the soil dry out than to overwater it, as "swamp" conditions in the pot cause root rot.</p>
            <p>In summer, it is useful to mist the Shefflera 2-3 times a week using a spray bottle.</p>

            <p><b>For fertilizing Shefflera, it is recommended to use a liquid universal fertilizer for decorative foliage plants.</b></p>
            <p>During the active growing period (from March to September), fertilize once every two weeks, following the instructions on the package. In the winter, it is enough to fertilize once a month.</p>
            <p>Shefflera benefits from fertilizers that contain both macro- and microelements (complex universal fertilizers).</p>

            <p><b>Some diseases of Shefflera:</b></p>
            <p>Root rot. The leaves become covered with small brown spots, which then grow, darken, and eventually turn completely black. This is caused by excessive watering, especially during the off-season.</p>
            <p>Leaf drop. When this happens gradually, early in spring or autumn, and only at the bottom, it is a natural process and does not require intervention. If it occurs in summer or winter, the causes are often related to temperature conditions, excess nitrogen, or lack of fertilizers.</p>
            <p>Leaf tip dryness. This symptom is most often caused by excessively dry air. The Shefflera needs to be misted periodically, especially in winter when the heating system is working intensively.</p>
