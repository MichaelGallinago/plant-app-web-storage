            <p>Transplant anthurium once every 2 years or when the pot becomes too small. The best time for transplantation is spring, as the plant recovers faster from possible root damage.</p>
            <p>Use a pot whose diameter is 20% wider than the previous one. Anthurium prefers airy soil with a high peat content, such as special soil for anthuriums. If the pot has a drainage hole, add hydrogel for better drainage of excess water.</p>

            <img src="https://topplant.ru/assets/images/blog/anturium/anturium2.jpg" alt="Watering">
            <p>Anthurium does not consume much water, but its soil should be kept slightly moist at all times. During the winter months, the soil may occasionally dry out a little.</p>
            <p><b>In winter: </b>1–2 times per week</p>
            <p><b>In summer: </b>2–3 times per week in spring and summer</p>
            <p>Anthurium that receives too much water may develop brown spots with yellow edges on the leaves, and sometimes the leaves turn yellow along the edges. This is due to root rot caused by constant waterlogging in the pot. If the anthurium is placed farther from the window, it consumes less water, increasing the likelihood of rotting.</p>

            <img src="https://topplant.ru/assets/images/blog/anturium/anturium2.jpg" alt="Spraying">
            <p>Anthurium is a tropical plant that naturally grows in humid environments, making regular spraying an essential part of its care routine.</p>
            <p><b>Importance of spraying for anthurium:</b></p>
            <p>1. Humidity requirements: Anthurium thrives in high humidity environments (60-80%). Regular spraying helps maintain the necessary humidity level, especially in dry indoor conditions.</p>
            <p>2. Leaf health: Spraying keeps the leaves clean, dust-free, and glossy, enhancing the plant's ornamental value and photosynthesis efficiency.</p>
            <p>3. Pest prevention: Adequate humidity through spraying helps prevent spider mites and other pests that prefer dry conditions.</p>
            <p><b>Recommended spraying routine:</b></p>
            <p>• Frequency: During the growing season (spring and summer), spray anthurium daily or every other day. In winter, reduce to 2-3 times per week.</p>
            <p>• Timing: Morning spraying is ideal as it allows leaves to dry during the day, reducing the risk of fungal diseases.</p>
            <p>• Water quality: Use only soft, room-temperature water (filtered, distilled, or rainwater). Hard water can leave mineral deposits on the leaves.</p>
            <p>• Technique: Create a fine mist around and over the plant, ensuring the spray reaches both the upper and lower leaf surfaces. Avoid excessive water accumulation in the leaf axils or flower spathes.</p>
            <p><b>Additional humidity methods:</b></p>
            <p>• Humidity tray: Place the pot on a tray filled with pebbles and water, ensuring the pot doesn't sit directly in water.</p>
            <p>• Grouping plants: Place your anthurium near other tropical plants to create a more humid microclimate.</p>
            <p>• Humidifier: In particularly dry environments or during winter heating season, use an electric humidifier near the plant.</p>
            <p>• Bathroom placement: Anthuriums can benefit from the naturally higher humidity in bathrooms with windows.</p>
            <p>The optimal spraying interval for anthurium is every 1-2 days during active growth and every 3 days during dormancy. Adjust based on your specific indoor conditions—increase frequency in dry environments and decrease in naturally humid ones.</p>
            <p>Note: While spraying the foliage, try to avoid wetting the flowers as this can cause spotting and reduce their lifespan. If the flowers do get wet, gently shake off excess moisture.</p>

            <p>6-8 weeks after planting, the nutrients in the soil are depleted, and the anthurium needs fertilization. Use special fertilizers for flowering plants, strictly following the dosage instructions on the package. Avoid over-fertilization, especially in autumn and winter, as this can harm the plant.</p>

            <p>Anthurium may encounter various problems:</p>
            <p><b>Brown-yellow leaf edges: </b>Incorrect watering (too much or too little water).</p>
            <p><b>Yellowing leaves: </b>Excessive sunlight.</p>
            <p><b>Greenish flowers: </b>Insufficient light.</p>
            <p><b>Pests: </b>Use insecticides.</p>

            <p>Lighting: Place the anthurium in a bright spot without direct sunlight. The ideal location is in front of a north-facing window.</p>
            <p>Pruning: Prune wilted flowers and old leaves low to the ground to save the plant's energy.</p>
            <p>Propagation: Use stem cuttings, planting them vertically in a mixture of peat and sand at a temperature of 25°C.</p>
