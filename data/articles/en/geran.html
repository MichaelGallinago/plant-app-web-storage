            <p><b>Recommended steps for proper geranium transplantation:</b></p>
            <p>1. Prepare the soil. A universal substrate for flowering houseplants will work well.</p>
            <p>2. Place a thick layer of drainage at the bottom of the pot, preferably large clay pellets.</p>
            <p>3. If the transplant is due to root overgrowth, place the geranium in the new pot with the soil clump. If the plant was overwatered, do so without it.</p>
            <p>4. Add soil to the pot while holding the plant in the air.</p>
            <p>5. Add prolonged-release universal fertilizer.</p>
            <p>Transplanting geraniums is best done at the beginning of the growing season — late February or early March, before the plant blooms, as it should not be transplanted during flowering.</p>
            <p>For a heavily overgrown bush, a new pot should be only 3–5 cm wider than the old one.</p>

            <a href="https://ibb.co/TT4dMKV"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/Jdvgjxf/geran-2.webp" alt="geran-2" border="0"></a>
            <p>Before watering, check if the top layer of soil has dried (insert a finger or a thin stick into the soil). If the soil is still wet, postpone watering.</p>
            <p>In summer, water the geranium every 2–4 days as the soil dries out. In autumn, gradually reduce the frequency of watering to abundant but infrequent moistening once every 10–14 days.</p>
            <p>Only use room-temperature water for watering — boiled, filtered, or at least settled for several days.</p>

            <p>Geraniums prefer fertilizers high in phosphorus and potassium. For example, monopotassium phosphate (50% phosphorus, 30% potassium). As this fertilizer is very concentrated, it should be used at 1/3 of the recommended dosage: 1 gram per 2 liters of water.</p>
            <p>Agricola fertilizer for flowering plants with NPK 15-21-25 is also suitable. It should be used at half the recommended dosage: 2 grams per 2 liters of water.</p>
            <p>Another suitable fertilizer for geraniums is "Good Strength" liquid fertilizer. It contains potassium, phosphorus, zinc, boron, iron, manganese, succinic acid, vitamins (B1, PP), and humates. Feed the plant once every 7–10 days with a solution of 10 ml of fertilizer per 1 liter of water from March to October.</p>

            <p><b>Some common geranium diseases and their treatments:</b></p>
            <p>• Gray mold: Brown spots appear on leaves and stems. Treat with fungicides (e.g., "Vitaros", "Fundazole").</p>
            <p>• Alternaria: Leaves show spots with white bloom. Provide ventilation, loosen the soil, reduce watering, and apply fungicides ("Ridomil", "Gold").</p>
            <p>• Verticillium wilt: Leaves and flowers turn yellow. Remove dry parts, provide moderate watering, and treat with "Trichodermin" for prevention.</p>
            <p>• Rust: Yellow and brown spots appear on leaves, which then dry and fall off. Remove infected leaves, stop spraying, reduce humidity, and treat with "Topaz".</p>
            <p>• Bacterial rot: Watery spots appear on leaves, causing them to dry but remain attached. Remove affected parts, stop spraying, add potassium fertilizers, and treat with "Oxychom".</p>
            <p>• Edema: Occurs mainly in ivy-leaved geraniums as bumps on the underside of leaves due to overwatering, humid, and cool air. To prevent further symptoms, change the drainage, reduce watering, and improve ventilation.</p>

            <p><b>Interesting facts about geraniums:</b></p>
            <p>1. What we commonly call geranium is actually Pelargonium.</p>
            <p>2. In nature, geraniums grow in South Africa, with more than 250 species.</p>
            <p>3. Several European countries, including Switzerland, have chosen this flower as a national symbol.</p>
            <p>4. Leaves and flowers of some aromatic geranium varieties are edible and are used in haute cuisine to garnish dishes and desserts.</p>
            <p>5. Some aromatic varieties contain essential oils that repel insects.</p>
            <p>6. With proper care, geraniums can grow to impressive sizes: bushes can reach up to 5 or even 10 meters.</p>
