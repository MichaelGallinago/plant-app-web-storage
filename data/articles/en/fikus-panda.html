            <p>It is best to transplant the Ficus Panda as needed.</p>
            <p>For mature plants and bonsai, the topsoil is renewed annually by removing contaminated soil and adding fresh clean substrate in early spring. A full transplant is postponed until the roots have occupied all the soil and begin to emerge from the drainage holes.</p>
            <p>Young Ficus Panda plants are transplanted annually. During transplantation, the root ball should not be disturbed, and the depth of the root neck should remain the same.</p>
            <p>A standard ficus potting mix is suitable for the substrate. If preparing the soil mix yourself, combine equal parts of soddy soil, leafy soil, peat, and sand. The soil should be water- and air-permeable, loose, but not too light. The optimal soil reaction is neutral.</p>
            <p>A high drainage layer (expanded clay or crushed brick works best) is placed at the bottom of the container.</p>
            <p>After transplantation, the ficus is shaded and kept in higher air humidity than usual until it begins to grow again.</p>

                 alt="Watering Ficus Panda">
            <p>The Ficus Panda requires regular and moderate watering. The soil in the pot should always remain slightly moist. In summer, water abundantly, but at other times of the year, only after the top layer of soil has dried out.</p>
            <p>Prolonged waterlogging of the soil should be avoided. Excess moisture poses a greater danger than lack of water.</p>
            <p>It is recommended to use only soft water for watering. In winter - warm, and in spring and autumn - at room temperature.</p>

                 alt="Fertilizing Ficus Panda">
            <p>Fertilize the Ficus Panda only during the period of active growth from spring to early October, once every 2–3 weeks. It is recommended to use special fertilizers for ficuses or universal fertilizers for decorative leafy plants.</p>
            <p>You can also use folk methods. Watering with tea is suitable, but the tea should not be of the first brew.</p>
