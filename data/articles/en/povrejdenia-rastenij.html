        <p>Plants are not only an essential part of the ecosystem but also a source of beauty, health, and well-being for humans. However, like all living organisms, they are prone to various types of damage that can significantly affect their health and development. Plant damages can be caused by numerous factors, including mechanical impacts, unfavorable weather conditions, pests, and diseases. These damages can appear in various forms, from cuts and fractures to burns and rot, each requiring special attention and treatment.</p>
        <p>In this article, we will examine the main types of damages that gardeners and plant enthusiasts may encounter, as well as their symptoms and ways to combat them. Understanding these aspects will not only help preserve plant health but also ensure their full development, which in turn will contribute to creating a beautiful and harmonious green space.</p>

                <h2>Cuts</h2>

                 alt="Cuts">
            <p><strong>Description</strong>: Cuts can occur due to mechanical damage caused by improper pruning, accidental contact with sharp objects such as pruning shears or knives, as well as the impact of strong winds that can break branches. If cuts are not treated, it can lead to infections, rotting, and even plant death.</p>
            <p><strong>Symptoms</strong>: Cuts may expose areas of bark, which may show darkening or even rotting around the damaged area. In some cases, the plant may begin to secrete resin in response to the damage, which is a protective reaction.</p>
            <p><strong>How to Treat</strong>:</p>
            <p>Treating cuts with antiseptics, such as copper sulfate solution, to prevent pathogen entry.</p>
            <p>Applying tree wound paste to exposed areas to protect against infections and speed up healing.</p>
            <p>Removing severely damaged parts of the plant to prevent the spread of infection.</p>

                 alt="Fractures">
            <p><strong>Description</strong>: Fractures often occur due to strong mechanical impacts, such as during strong winds, snow loads, or accidental collisions with objects. Fractured branches can continue to receive water and nutrients, but their ability to perform photosynthesis and other functions may be disrupted.</p>
            <p><strong>Symptoms</strong>: Branches or stems in a fractured state may hang at an angle, causing the entire plant to deform. Leaves on the fractured areas may begin to yellow and dry out, and the stem may show cracks or tears.</p>
            <p><strong>How to Treat</strong>:</p>
            <p>Supporting fractured branches with stakes or wires so they can recover.</p>
            <p>Treating the fracture site with tree wound paste to protect against infections and promote healing.</p>
            <p>Removing severely damaged parts if they cannot recover.</p>

                 alt="Burns">
            <p><strong>Description</strong>: Burns can be caused by several factors, including sunlight, high temperatures, and chemical substances such as fertilizers or pesticides. Sunburns most often occur in young and delicate plants that have not yet adapted to sunlight. Chemical burns can happen due to improper use of chemicals.</p>
            <p><strong>Symptoms</strong>: Burns may appear as brown or white spots on the leaves, which can increase in size and lead to tissue death. In the case of sunburns, the leaves may appear dried and brittle.</p>
            <p><strong>How to Treat</strong>:</p>
            <p>For sunburns, shade can be used, such as covering the plant from direct sunlight with nets or other materials.</p>
            <p>For chemical burns, it's important to use fertilizers and pesticides correctly and use protective gear.</p>
            <p>Regular watering helps prevent overheating and maintain plant health.</p>

                 alt="Animal Bites">
            <p><strong>Description</strong>: Bites can be caused by pets, such as dogs or cats, that may chew or scratch plants. These damages can lead to infections and weaken the plant, especially if the bark is damaged.</p>
            <p><strong>Symptoms</strong>: Bites can manifest as damaged areas of bark, tears on stems, and loss of leaves. Bite marks and scratches may also be visible on stems and leaves.</p>
            <p><strong>How to Treat</strong>:</p>
            <p>Protecting plants with barriers or nets to prevent pets from accessing them.</p>
            <p>Treating damaged areas with antiseptics to prevent infections.</p>
            <p>Removing severely damaged parts of the plant to prevent further infection spread.</p>

                 alt="Hail Damage">
            <p><strong>Description</strong>: Hail can cause significant damage, especially during flowering and fruiting periods. The impacts of hailstones can be strong enough to damage both leaves and fruits, leading to reduced yield and quality.</p>
            <p><strong>Symptoms</strong>: Hail damage may appear as dents and tears on leaves and fruits, as well as a loss of fruit juiciness. In some cases, leaves may completely die, and fruits may lose their appeal and nutritional value.</p>
            <p><strong>How to Treat</strong>:</p>
            <p>Covering plants during hail with protective nets or film to minimize damage.</p>
            <p>Removing severely damaged parts and treating the remaining areas to prevent infections.</p>
            <p>Using fertilizers and growth stimulants to support plant recovery after hail.</p>

                 alt="Insect Damage">
            <p><strong>Description</strong>: Pests such as aphids, caterpillars, thrips, and spider mites can cause serious harm to plants by sucking out sap and disrupting photosynthesis. These damages can weaken the plant and reduce its resistance to diseases.</p>
            <p><strong>Symptoms</strong>: Deformed leaves, bite marks, spider webs (e.g., from spider mites), and discolored tissues. In some cases, insects may be visible on the plants.</p>
            <p><strong>How to Treat</strong>:</p>
            <p>Regularly inspecting plants for pests and their signs.</p>
            <p>Using insecticides or natural solutions, such as soapy water, to fight pests.</p>
            <p>Attracting natural predators, such as ladybugs, to help control the pest population.</p>

                 alt="Frostbite">
            <p><strong>Description</strong>: Frostbite occurs when plants are exposed to low temperatures, especially combined with strong winds. This can lead to cell damage and disrupt the normal functioning of the plant.</p>
            <p><strong>Symptoms</strong>: Brown or black spots on leaves, which may become brittle and break. In some cases, leaves may completely die, and stems may crack.</p>
            <p><strong>How to Treat</strong>:</p>
            <p>Covering plants at night on cold days with agro-fiber or other materials.</p>
            <p>Moving plants to more protected areas, if possible, to minimize cold air exposure.</p>
            <p>Applying mulch around the roots to protect against freezing and maintain stable soil temperature.</p>
