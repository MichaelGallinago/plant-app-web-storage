                 alt="Transplantation">
            <p>The Zamia, or dollar tree, needs to be transplanted once every 3–4 years. Young plants should be transplanted every spring into a pot that is slightly larger than the previous one. It is important to choose a deep and narrow pot so that the tuber fits comfortably and quickly adapts to the soil.</p>
            <p><b>Transplantation Method:</b></p>
            <p>1. Fill the new pot with a drainage layer and a small amount of soil.</p>
            <p>2. Leave a hollow for the root ball.</p>
            <p>3. Remove the tuber from the old pot and place it in the new pot along with the attached soil.</p>
            <p>4. Cover with soil and allow the plant to settle in.</p>

                 alt="Watering">
            <p>Zamia prefers a dry climate and does not tolerate excess moisture well. Water the plant moderately, only when the soil has clearly dried out, which usually happens once every 10–14 days. Use soft, filtered water at room temperature.</p>

            <p><b>Watering Frequency:</b></p>
            <p>Spring, summer, early autumn: once every 10–14 days.</p>
            <p>Winter: once every 1.5–2 months.</p>

            <p>For fertilizing Zamia, use universal vitamins for ornamental foliage plants, nitrogen fertilizers in lower concentrations, cactus or succulent mixes, as well as folk remedies such as eggshells and spraying with a weak hibiscus infusion.</p>

            <p>Universal vitamins (e.g., "Aminosil").</p>

                 alt="Information">
            <p>Do not overwater the plant as this can lead to tuber rot.</p>
            <p>Avoid overly spacious pots as this can slow down the growth of new leaves.</p>
            <p>For spraying, use slightly warm water no more than twice a month.</p>
            <p>Zamia is well-suited for bedrooms as it oxygenates the air and does not accumulate much dust.</p>
