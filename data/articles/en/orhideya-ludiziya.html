            <p><b>Step-by-step guide for transplanting Ludisia Orchid:</b></p>
            <p>1. Prepare the pot: fill it with drainage material and add a layer of substrate. It is best to use a special substrate for orchids that contains bark, sphagnum moss, and perlite. This will help air circulation around the roots.</p>
            <p>2. Place moss (preferably live) on top of the substrate. Before using, soak it for 1 hour in warm water (up to 40 °C) to remove slugs and snails.</p>
            <p>3. Remove the Ludisia from the old container. Use a wooden stick to scrape off any old filler from the roots (only those pieces that come off easily). Then rinse the root system in boiled water.</p>
            <p>4. Place the plant vertically in the pot, carefully spread out the roots, and add the remaining soil mixture.</p>
            <p>5. If the substrate is wet, do not water the plant immediately to allow the roots to adapt faster after transplanting.</p>
            <p>Transplant Ludisia about every 2-4 years, preferably in the spring.</p>
            <p>After transplanting, it is recommended to keep the orchid in the shade for a few days to help it adapt.</p>

                 alt="Watering Ludisia Orchid">
            <p>Ludisia Orchid should be watered regularly throughout the year. Between waterings, allow the substrate in the pot to dry, but not completely dry out. If the soil dries out too quickly, you can water it more often. During the dormant period, reduce watering.</p>
            <p>Use soft water at room temperature. Excess moisture can lead to root rot.</p>

                 alt="Fertilizer for Ludisia Orchid">
            <p>Ludisia Orchid should be fertilized during its active growth and blooming periods with a special orchid fertilizer.</p>
            <p>Fertilizing should be done every third watering. Add enough fertilizer to make the solution half as strong as the amount recommended in the fertilizer instructions.</p>
            <p>Choose the dosage based on the instructions on the packaging or slightly less than the recommended amount. To avoid burning the roots, apply the fertilizer along with watering or after immersing the plant in water.</p>
            <p>If Ludisia is growing in a complex mixture, no fertilizing is necessary.</p>
            <p>In the autumn-winter period, fertilizing should be done once every 5 weeks.</p>

            <p><b>Some interesting facts about Ludisia Orchid:</b></p>
            <p>• Ludisia is called a precious orchid because its flowers resemble pearl threads, and its leaves are covered with silvery patterns.</p>
            <p>• In the wild, Ludisia grows in the humid forests of Eastern and Central Asia, on the ground or on moss-covered cave walls.</p>
            <p>• The leaves of Ludisia can maintain their decorative appearance for up to 7 years, after which they die, leaving a ring-like mark on the stem.</p>
            <p>• Ludisia prefers warm temperatures between 18-24 °C, regardless of the season.</p>
            <p>• Ludisia thrives in partial shade, although it can withstand morning or evening sunlight.</p>
            <p>• Thanks to the collector N. A. Bersenev, unique varieties of Ludisia, which no longer exist in the wild, have been preserved. He was the first to master the cultivation of this orchid in domestic conditions in the 20th century.</p>
