            <p>The recommended steps for transplanting ivy are:</p>
            <p>1. Prepare a new pot and loose soil. The pot should be 2–3 cm larger than the previous one.</p>
            <p>2. Remove the plant from the old pot, keeping soil on the roots.</p>
            <p>3. Check the root system for defects or diseases. If found, remove the affected parts.</p>
            <p>4. Place the plant in the new pot and cover the roots with soil.</p>
            <p><pre> </pre></p>
            <p>Young ivies (up to three years old) should be transplanted annually, while mature plants should be transplanted every one or two years. However, the top layer of soil should be replaced yearly: remove soil saturated with salts and add fresh soil.</p>

            <summary><h2>When to Water Ivy</h2></summary>
            <a href='https://postimg.cc/3yD5bPjw' target='_blank'><img src='https://i.postimg.cc/q71Jgrz2/2817-F383-D958-4772-BE04-1-B496445-B9-A9.webp' border='0' alt='Ivy Watering'/></a>
            <p>During the spring-summer period, ivy should be watered abundantly as the top layer of substrate dries out. Prolonged dryness (one or two days) is harmful.</p>
            <p>In autumn-winter, water sparingly, moderately, two or three days after the top layer dries, with a small amount of water.</p>

            <summary><h2>Water Spraying for Ivy</h2></summary>
            <a href='https://postimg.cc/c6d1rLMM' target='_blank'><img src='https://i.postimg.cc/zDgy2LyM/1624368-E-A422-484-D-B33-F-C57-D19233-C9-D.webp' border='0' alt='Ivy Spraying'/></a>
            <p><b>Ivy plants benefit from regular water spraying to maintain humidity:</b></p>
            <p>1. Frequency: Spray ivy approximately every 2 days during the growing season. This helps maintain the necessary humidity level around the plant, especially in dry indoor environments.</p>
            <p>2. Water quality: Always use room temperature, settled water for spraying. Cold water can shock the plant, while tap water with chlorine may damage the leaves.</p>
            <p>3. Technique: Mist the entire plant lightly, focusing on both the top and underside of leaves. This helps keep dust from accumulating and maintains the plant's vibrant appearance.</p>
            <p>4. Timing: Morning is the ideal time for spraying, allowing leaves to dry during the day and reducing the risk of fungal diseases that can develop in prolonged moisture.</p>
            <p>5. Seasonal adjustments: During winter when indoor heating creates dry air, maintain regular spraying to counteract the low humidity. In summer, you may need to increase frequency if the air is particularly dry.</p>
            <p>6. Alternative methods: In addition to spraying, you can increase humidity by placing the pot on a tray with pebbles and water (ensuring the pot doesn't sit directly in water) or by grouping ivy with other plants to create a microclimate.</p>
            <p>7. Caution: If you notice any signs of disease or pest infestation, temporarily reduce spraying until the issue is resolved, as excess moisture can exacerbate some problems.</p>
            <p>Regular spraying is particularly important for maintaining the glossy appearance of ivy leaves and supporting overall plant health in typical indoor environments.</p>

            <summary><h2>Fertilizing Ivy</h2></summary>
            <a href='https://postimg.cc/sv62FCWP' target='_blank'><img src='https://i.postimg.cc/6pw4v95P/1-BE4-FD32-CB12-4940-80-C7-9-B82210-EAB8-A.jpg' border='0' alt='Ivy Fertilization'/></a>
            <p>Ivy is fertilized with a complex fertilizer for decorative leafy plants. You can use fertilizers like "4 Barrels," "Pocon," "Agricola," "Bona Forte," and others labeled for leafy plants (including palms, ficuses).</p>
            <p>During the active growth period (spring-summer), fertilize ivy once a month. During the dormant period (autumn-winter), reduce feeding to once every 2–3 months, as an excess of nutrients at this time can harm the plant.</p>
            <p>During the warm season, you can alternate mineral preparations with organic ones and apply foliar feeding. From late autumn to early spring, when growth slows down, feeding once a month is sufficient.</p>

            <p><b>Some common ivy diseases and treatments:</b></p>
            <p>1. Root rot. Cause: Overwatering. Treatment: Immediate treatment with a fungicide (e.g., "Fitosporin"), repotting the plant into a new pot with fresh soil. During repotting, all rotted roots should be removed, and the cut areas should be treated with activated charcoal.</p>
            <p>2. Pest infestation. Ivy is often affected by spider mites, scale insects, and aphids. Symptoms include rapid leaf yellowing, drying, and falling. Insecticides or soap solutions can be used to combat pests. Thoroughly treat the crown, repeating the procedure after a week.</p>
            <p>3. Leaf yellowing. Yellowing leaves indicate excessive moisture or fertilizer. Allow the soil to dry and strictly follow the watering schedule.</p>

            <p><b>Some interesting facts about ivy:</b></p>
            <p>1. Ivy is perfect for vertical greening of rooms. Its aerial roots allow it to easily cling to small protrusions, gradually covering all available space.</p>
            <p>2. Ivy has medicinal properties. It purifies the air of toxins and enriches it with oxygen. It is used in folk recipes for bronchitis treatment and in some cosmetic products.</p>
            <p>3. Under optimal conditions, small yellow-green buds form at the tips of the stems. After flowering, light green berries appear, which turn black as they ripen. These berries contain toxic substances.</p>
