            <p><b>Dracaena should be transplanted approximately every 2-3 years, usually in the spring.</b></p>
            <p>Dracaena has a shallow root system, so it's important to ensure good drainage at the bottom of the pot
                to avoid water stagnation. Use a ready-made soil mix for palms. If the soil is not exhausted, but the
                plant needs transplanting, you can transplant it by gently moving it into a larger pot while keeping the
                root ball intact. Before transplanting, rinse a clay pot with boiling water and soak it in water to open
                the pores of the clay.
                Place a piece of clay pot at the bottom of the pot, concave side up, for better water drainage, and then
                add a 20-30 mm layer of drainage.
                After transplanting, water the plant and mist the leaves with a spray bottle, then place the plant in a
                warm, shaded area.</p>

            <p><b>Watering Dracaena depends on the season.</b></p>
            <p>During the spring and summer, water the plant generously and consistently when the top 20-30 mm of soil
                dries out. This typically happens every 2 days.</p>
            <p>In winter, water Dracaena only twice a month. The key is to ensure that the top 5-6 cm of soil dries out
                without drying out the root ball at the bottom. If the plant isn't watered enough, the tips of the
                leaves will droop slightly as a signal.</p>

            <p>For feeding Dracaena, use a complex mineral fertilizer for decorative-leafed plants. Apply fertilizer
                every 15 days from April to September. Fertilizing is not needed during the winter.</p>

                 alt="Dracaena Pests and Diseases">
            <p>Dracaena can undergo various changes and diseases. Here are the main issues and their solutions:</p>

            <p><b>Yellowing Leaves:</b> If young leaves turn yellow, it could indicate improper watering. Water the plant
                when the top 20-30 mm of soil dries out.</p>
            <p><b>Dry Leaf Edges:</b> This indicates dry air. Mist the plant with a spray bottle.</p>
            <p><b>Dry Leaf Edges:</b> This may appear due to bacterial issues, insufficient lighting, low temperatures, or
                water stagnation. Remove affected leaves and address care issues.</p>
            <p><b>Leaf Drop:</b> This can be caused by low temperatures or water stagnation in the soil. Transplant the
                plant into fresh soil and root healthy parts of the stem.</p>
            <p><b>Pests:</b> Dracaena can be attacked by scale insects, aphids, mealybugs, thrips, and spider mites. Use
                a soapy solution to wipe the leaves or apply insecticidal treatments.</p>

            <p><b>Pruning:</b> Pruning Dracaena is combined with propagation. If the plant loses its decorative value,
                cut off the top and root it.</p>
            <p><b>Propagation:</b> Dracaena can be propagated by seeds, top cuttings, or stem segments. For rooting
                cuttings, you can use water.</p>
            <p><b>Lighting:</b> Dracaena prefers well-lit areas, but avoid direct sunlight. Variegated varieties are more
                light-loving.</p>
