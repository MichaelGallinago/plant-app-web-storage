            <p><b>Dracaena should be transplanted approximately every 2-3 years, usually in the spring.</b></p>
            <p>Dracaena has a shallow root system, so it's important to ensure good drainage at the bottom of the pot
                to avoid water stagnation. Use a ready-made soil mix for palms. If the soil is not exhausted, but the
                plant needs transplanting, you can transplant it by gently moving it into a larger pot while keeping the
                root ball intact. Before transplanting, rinse a clay pot with boiling water and soak it in water to open
                the pores of the clay.
                Place a piece of clay pot at the bottom of the pot, concave side up, for better water drainage, and then
                add a 20-30 mm layer of drainage.
                After transplanting, water the plant and mist the leaves with a spray bottle, then place the plant in a
                warm, shaded area.</p>

                <h2>When to Water Dracaena</h2>

            <p><b>Watering Dracaena depends on the season.</b></p>
            <p>During the spring and summer, water the plant generously and consistently when the top 20-30 mm of soil
                dries out. This typically happens every 2 days.</p>
            <p>In winter, water Dracaena only twice a month. The key is to ensure that the top 5-6 cm of soil dries out
                without drying out the root ball at the bottom. If the plant isn't watered enough, the tips of the
                leaves will droop slightly as a signal.</p>

                <h2>Spraying Dracaena</h2>
            </summary>
            <img src="https://rastenievod.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/5-63.jpg" alt="Spraying Dracaena">
            <p>Dracaena plants originate from tropical regions and benefit greatly from regular spraying to maintain optimal health and appearance.</p>
            <p><b>Importance of spraying for dracaena:</b></p>
            <p>1. Humidity requirements: Dracaenas naturally grow in humid environments and prefer humidity levels of 40-50%. Regular spraying helps maintain these levels, especially in dry indoor conditions with heating or air conditioning.</p>
            <p>2. Dust removal: Dracaena leaves, particularly broader varieties like Dracaena fragrans, tend to collect dust which can block light absorption and reduce photosynthesis efficiency. Regular spraying helps keep the leaves clean and glossy.</p>
            <p>3. Pest prevention: Adequate humidity through spraying helps prevent spider mites and other pests that prefer dry conditions. These pests can quickly damage dracaena foliage if left unchecked.</p>
            <p><b>Recommended spraying routine:</b></p>
            <p>• Frequency: During the growing season (spring and summer), spray dracaena 2-3 times per week. In winter, reduce to once weekly, but don't stop completely as indoor heating systems can create very dry conditions.</p>
            <p>• Water quality: Use only soft, room-temperature water (filtered, distilled, or rainwater). Dracaenas are sensitive to fluoride and chlorine in tap water, which can cause brown leaf tips and margins.</p>
            <p>• Timing: Morning spraying is best as it allows leaves to dry during the day, reducing the risk of fungal diseases.</p>
            <p>• Technique: Create a fine mist around and over the plant, ensuring the spray reaches both the upper and lower leaf surfaces. For larger specimens, pay special attention to the inner leaves which can collect dust.</p>
            <p><b>Additional humidity methods for dracaenas:</b></p>
            <p>• Humidity tray: Place the pot on a tray filled with pebbles and water, ensuring the pot doesn't sit directly in water.</p>
            <p>• Grouping plants: Place your dracaena near other plants to create a more humid microclimate.</p>
            <p>• Room humidifier: In particularly dry environments, use an electric humidifier near the plant, especially during winter months.</p>
            <p>• Occasional shower: Every 1-2 months, you can give your dracaena a gentle shower with lukewarm water to thoroughly clean the leaves and provide deep hydration.</p>
            <p>The optimal spraying interval for dracaenas is every 2-3 days during active growth periods, and once weekly during dormancy. During extremely hot and dry periods, daily spraying may be beneficial.</p>
            <p>Note: If you notice brown leaf tips despite regular spraying, this could indicate sensitivity to chemicals in your water. Try switching to filtered or distilled water, or leave tap water out overnight before using it for spraying.</p>

            <p>For feeding Dracaena, use a complex mineral fertilizer for decorative-leafed plants. Apply fertilizer
                every 15 days from April to September. Fertilizing is not needed during the winter.</p>

                 alt="Dracaena Pests and Diseases">
            <p>Dracaena can undergo various changes and diseases. Here are the main issues and their solutions:</p>

            <p><b>Yellowing Leaves:</b> If young leaves turn yellow, it could indicate improper watering. Water the plant
                when the top 20-30 mm of soil dries out.</p>
            <p><b>Dry Leaf Edges:</b> This indicates dry air. Mist the plant with a spray bottle.</p>
            <p><b>Dry Leaf Edges:</b> This may appear due to bacterial issues, insufficient lighting, low temperatures, or
                water stagnation. Remove affected leaves and address care issues.</p>
            <p><b>Leaf Drop:</b> This can be caused by low temperatures or water stagnation in the soil. Transplant the
                plant into fresh soil and root healthy parts of the stem.</p>
            <p><b>Pests:</b> Dracaena can be attacked by scale insects, aphids, mealybugs, thrips, and spider mites. Use
                a soapy solution to wipe the leaves or apply insecticidal treatments.</p>

            <p><b>Pruning:</b> Pruning Dracaena is combined with propagation. If the plant loses its decorative value,
                cut off the top and root it.</p>
            <p><b>Propagation:</b> Dracaena can be propagated by seeds, top cuttings, or stem segments. For rooting
                cuttings, you can use water.</p>
            <p><b>Lighting:</b> Dracaena prefers well-lit areas, but avoid direct sunlight. Variegated varieties are more
                light-loving.</p>
