            <p><b>For proper transplantation of Ficus Microcarpa, the following is recommended:</b></p>
            <p>1. Transplant in mid-spring, after the start of active growth.</p>
            <p>2. Use containers suitable for bonsai—shallow, wide, with drainage holes. The new pot should be 40 mm larger than the old one.</p>
            <p>3. Prepare the substrate. It should be breathable, coarse, preferably special for bonsai or ficus. If making your own, mix equal parts of leaf soil, sod soil, peat, and sand with additives of clay, ash, and loosening agents.</p>
            <p>4. Lay a high drainage layer: pour the drainage layer with substrate and place the plant in the container.</p>
            <p>5. Gradually fill the pot with the soil mixture, compacting it around the roots. The plant's root collar should remain at the same level as before transplanting.</p>
            <p>6. Water the transplanted plant, and when the water is completely absorbed, add fresh soil mixture to the pot.</p>
            <p>After transplanting, shade the plant for several days and do not water it for 7 days. The first fertilization is done 2 weeks after transplanting. If the plant is very large, only the top layer of soil mixture is replaced with fresh substrate.</p>

                 alt="Watering Ficus">
            <p><b>Ficus Microcarpa needs moderate watering when the soil is well dried.</b> This usually happens about twice a week. It is best to use settled water at room temperature.</p>
            <p><b>In winter, watering can be reduced to once a week.</b> Avoid overwatering, as excessive watering causes the plant to shed its leaves.</p>
            <p>It is important to ensure that the soil in the pot does not dry out completely and that water does not accumulate in the tray.</p>
            <p>Ficus Microcarpa also likes high humidity, so it is recommended to keep it near a humidifier or place a tray with pebbles and water under the pot.</p>

                 alt="Ficus Fertilization">
            <p>It is recommended to use special fertilizers for bonsai or decorative foliage plants to fertilize Ficus Microcarpa.</p>
            <p>Fertilization is carried out from March to November:</p>
            <p>• Root feeding: with watering every 2 weeks at the standard dosage (after transplantation, feeding is stopped for 8 weeks).</p>
            <p>• Foliar feeding: every 2–3 weeks, at a 4–5 times reduced fertilizer concentration.</p>
            <p>During the dormant period (November–February), fertilizing once every 30–40 days is sufficient.</p>
            <p>Liquid fertilizers are preferred for ficuses, as they are quickly released, immediately absorbed, and do not accumulate in the soil.</p>
            <p>After fertilizing, the plant should be protected from direct sunlight for 24 hours.</p>

            <p><b>Some diseases of Ficus Microcarpa and ways to treat them:</b></p>
            <p>• Dark spots on leaves - can appear due to excessive sunlight, poor air circulation, and waterlogged soil. Solution: improve ventilation, avoid watering from above, and let the soil dry between waterings. Trim affected leaves if necessary.</p>
            <p>• Yellow spots on leaves - may indicate spider mite infestation. Solution: wash the leaves with tobacco dust infusion and soap, then rinse with warm water after two hours.</p>
            <p>• Root rot. Occurs due to overwatering. Solution: check the roots, trim dry or rotten areas, apply crushed charcoal to rotting areas, and provide good drainage and aeration of the soil. Treat with "Epin" after replanting.</p>
            <p>For accurate diagnosis and treatment, it is recommended to consult a specialist.</p>

            <p>2. In Borneo, it is called "strangler" because its roots wrap around the roots of nearby trees, hindering their growth.</p>
            <p>3. It can grow in various places such as rock slopes, asphalt cracks, and rooftops of tall buildings.</p>
            <p>4. Thick roots of the "Ginseng" variety are a result of selective breeding and special growing techniques.</p>
            <p>5. Unlike figs, Ficus Microcarpa produces very small fruits, which gave it its Latin name (Greek: mikros—small, karpos—fruit).</p>
            <p>6. Its dense crown is easy to shape, and even the trunk can be shortened in young plants.</p>
