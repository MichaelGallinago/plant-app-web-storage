            <p>Transplant aloe vera in spring as the roots grow. Choose a wide and shallow pot with drainage holes. The substrate can consist of a mixture of sand, perlite, and leaf soil to ensure drainage.</p>
            <p>To properly transplant aloe vera, follow these steps:</p>
            <p>1. Choose the time: Plan transplantation in spring or summer when the plant is in its growing phase. In winter, aloe "sleeps" and may struggle to adapt to new conditions.</p>
            <p>2. Prepare the pot: Its diameter should be 2–4 cm larger than the old one. The bottom must have drainage holes.</p>
            <p>3. Add drainage: You can use expanded clay or broken brick for this.</p>
            <p>4. Place the soil: You can buy a ready-made succulent substrate or make it yourself. Mix turf or leaf soil, humus, and coarse sand in a ratio of 2:1:1.</p>
            <p>5. Remove the plant from the old pot: Turn it upside down and carefully remove the soil from the roots.</p>
            <p>6. Place the aloe in the prepared pot: The root neck should be a couple of centimeters below the edge of the pot.</p>
            <p>7. Cover the roots with substrate, lightly compact the soil as you go.</p>
            <p>8. Shade the aloe and do not water for 4–5 days until it roots.</p>
            <p>After this, place the pot in its usual spot and care for the plant as normal.</p>

            <img src="https://fluxai.pro/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffal.media%2Ffiles%2Fkoala%2FHvsaupJk9z3IlTZPdTWjU_image.webp&w=1920&q=75" alt="Aloe Watering">
            <p>Water aloe vera when the substrate dries out. The watering frequency depends on the season and room temperature. During spring and summer, water no more than once a week. In winter, when the plant is dormant, reduce watering to once a month, considering the degree of soil drying.</p>
            <p>Use warm, settled water for watering. Overwatering is undesirable because it leads to root rot. When moisture is lacking, the leaves lose their elasticity, and the tips turn yellow and curl.</p>
            <p>To determine whether it's time to water, check the soil. If it's dry, watering is needed. If it's slightly moist, wait until it dries out completely.</p>

            <summary><h2>Spraying Aloe Vera</h2></summary>
            <img src="https://fluxai.pro/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffal.media%2Ffiles%2Fkoala%2FHvsaupJk9z3IlTZPdTWjU_image.webp&w=1920&q=75" alt="Aloe Spraying">
            <p>Aloe vera has specific requirements for spraying that differ from many other houseplants due to its succulent nature and desert origin.</p>
            <p><b>Important information about spraying aloe vera:</b></p>
            <p>1. Aloe vera generally does not require regular spraying. As a succulent plant adapted to arid environments, aloe stores water in its thick leaves and has evolved to thrive in dry conditions.</p>
            <p>2. Direct spraying of aloe leaves is not recommended as excess moisture on the leaves can lead to fungal diseases and rot, especially if water accumulates in the rosette center.</p>
            <p>3. In extremely dry indoor environments (humidity below 30%), occasional light misting of the air around the plant (not directly on it) can be beneficial, particularly during winter when heating systems reduce air humidity.</p>
            <p><b>Alternative humidity management for aloe vera:</b></p>
            <p>• Instead of spraying, wipe the leaves with a slightly damp cloth once every 2-3 weeks to remove dust and keep the leaves clean for better photosynthesis</p>
            <p>• Place the pot on a tray with pebbles and water (ensuring the pot bottom doesn't touch the water) to create a microclimate with slightly higher humidity around the plant</p>
            <p>• Group aloe with other plants that don't require high humidity to create a balanced microclimate</p>
            <p>• Use a room humidifier during extremely dry periods, but keep it at a distance from the aloe</p>
            <p>4. If you notice your aloe's leaves becoming wrinkled or shriveled, this typically indicates underwatering rather than low humidity. The solution is to adjust your watering schedule rather than increasing spraying.</p>
            <p>5. For cleaning purposes, you can occasionally give your aloe a gentle shower with lukewarm water, but ensure the plant has good drainage and can dry completely afterward.</p>
            <p>The optimal spraying interval for aloe vera is approximately once every 7 days during hot, dry periods, and only if the ambient humidity is extremely low. In normal conditions, spraying is unnecessary and may even be harmful.</p>
            <p>By following these guidelines, you'll maintain your aloe vera's health while avoiding common moisture-related problems that can affect this drought-tolerant plant.</p>

            <p><b>Recommended fertilizers for aloe vera:</b></p>
            <p>1. Organic fertilizers or humus. Humus contains potassium and nitrogen, applied once in spring during watering. Wood ash is also effective - dissolve it in boiling water (1:3), infuse for 3 days, and water the plant twice a month in spring.</p>
            <p>2. Mineral complex mixtures: Stores offer ready-made succulent fertilizers in liquid, powder, or granule form. Follow the instructions for proper dilution.</p>
            <p>3. Home remedies: Eggshells reduce soil acidity and enrich it with calcium. Rinse, dry, and crush the shells, then mix them into the soil or soak them in water for 7 days before watering. Another option is sugar: Sprinkle 1 teaspoon on the soil and water once a week.</p>
            <p>Fertilize aloe from March to October, once every 1–2 months. During winter, the plant is dormant and doesn't need fertilizing.</p>

            <p><b>Some aloe diseases and treatment methods:</b></p>
            <p>Root rot: In the early stages, aloe can be saved. Remove the plant from the pot, eliminate rotten root parts, treat the root system with fungicide, and plant in new soil. Do not water for three weeks. If detected too late, the plant cannot be saved.</p>
            <p>Dry rot: This fungus develops inside the plant and is difficult to detect. The plant slowly withers, leaves thin, deform, turn yellow, and eventually dry up. Prevent the disease by regular fungicide treatment.</p>
            <p>For disease prevention, maintain proper home care: spray regularly, avoid freezing, provide good lighting, and ensure the soil contains essential minerals.</p>
