                 alt="Transplantation">
            <p>Opuntia leucotricha prefers transplantation in the spring when the temperature is between 15-20 Â°C.
                Choose a sunny spot with well-drained soil.
                Use clay pots with good air permeability for houseplants.</p>
            <p>Before planting, expose the soil to bright sunlight and disinfect it to kill pathogens.
                Wear gloves or use tongs when planting to protect your fingers from the thorns.
                You can also wrap the plant in a towel to help with its movement.</p>

            <p><b>Transplantation schedule: every 2-3 years</b></p>

            <p>Opuntia leucotricha requires watering every 3 weeks.</p>
            <p>For indoor care, watering should be infrequent, about once every three weeks, ensuring that the soil dries out completely between sessions.
                As a species found in desert climates, opuntia leucotricha benefits from well-drained soil that mimics its natural habitat, preventing root rot.</p>

                 alt="Fertilizer">
            <p>Fertilize Opuntia leucotricha monthly with fertilizers designed for succulents and cacti during the growing season, from spring to late summer, to promote strength and flowering.
                Use half the recommended dose of water-soluble fertilizer to prevent root burn.</p>
            <p>Stop fertilizing during winter to align with the plant's dormant period.</p>
            <p>Monitor soil dryness before applying fertilizer; excessive fertilizer, especially on dry soil, can damage Opuntia leucotricha.
                Always follow the instructions on the packaging for dilution and amount to maintain the plant's health.</p>

            <p><b>Stem Spotting: </b>A fungal disease causing lesions on Opuntia leucotricha, affecting its vitality and aesthetic appearance.
                If left untreated, it can lead to significant damage, potentially lowering the plant's frost resistance.</p>

            <p><b>Scars: </b>Light marks that appear on the stems but do not grow in size or number. Protect the plant's stem and leaves from physical damage such as scratches.
                If the scars are caused by pests or diseases, isolate the plant from others to prevent spreading.</p>
            <p><b>Stem Rot: </b>A bacterial infection that can cause the stems to soften and rot.
                If the plant is only slightly infected, it can sometimes be saved. Remove the plant from the pot and gently shake off as much soil as possible.
                Using sanitized pruning tools, remove all diseased leaves and roots.
                Dip the plant's roots in a fungicide to kill any remaining fungal spores before replanting in a clean growing medium.</p>
            <p><b>Etiolation: </b>Due to lack of sunlight, the stems and leaves of the plant elongate and become lighter in color.
                Move the plant to a spot where it receives more light.
                Check the requirements for specific species, as too much sunlight can lead to plant burn.</p>

            <img src="https://stocvetov.ru/images/cms/data/razmnozhenie-kaktusov_1.jpg" alt="Information">
            <p>Opuntia leucotricha doesn't require much pruning. Remove faded flowers and branches so the plant can use nutrients for healthy growth.</p>
            <p>It propagates effectively through cuttings. A key practical tip is to allow the cuttings to callous for a few days before planting in well-drained soil.
                This helps prevent rot and promotes root development for successful rooting.
                Handle carefully to avoid injuries from the thorns and ensure optimal growth.</p>
