                 alt="Transplanting Venus Flytrap">
            <p>The Venus flytrap grown indoors requires regular transplantation, which should be done every 2 or 3
                years. The best time for this procedure is spring. Choose a tall, narrow flower pot for transplanting
                the plant, as its root system can reach up to 20 centimeters in length. Be very careful when transplanting
                the Venus flytrap, as its root system is quite fragile. First, remove the plant from the pot, then carefully
                remove all the soil from its roots. If the soil is difficult to remove, immerse the roots in water for a while.
                Clean the leaves using a spray bottle.</p>
            <p>The ideal soil mixture should consist of perlite, peat, and quartz sand (2:4:1). Before mixing the components,
                the sand should be boiled in distilled water, and perlite should be soaked in water for 7 days. Venus
                flytraps do not need a drainage layer. Once transplantation is complete, the plant needs 5 weeks of rest
                to adapt to the fresh soil. During this time, the plant should be kept in slight shade, and don’t forget to
                water it more frequently.</p>

            <p>The root system of this plant cannot process mineral salts from the soil, so it requires soft rainwater
                for watering. However, note that the water should be stored in plastic containers, not metal ones. If rainwater
                is unavailable, distilled water can be used as a substitute. Always ensure that the soil in the pot remains
                slightly moist. If the plant lacks water, its traps may die.</p>
            <p>It is not recommended to water the Venus flytrap using the usual method. Instead, place the pot on a tray,
                then pour water into the tray. Ensure that the drainage holes at the bottom of the pot are submerged in the
                water, so the plant can take in water when needed.</p>

            <p>This plant does not require fertilization, so there is no need to add any fertilizers to the soil. All the
                nutrients it needs are obtained from the insects it catches.</p>

            <p>Never feed this plant beetles with a hard chitinous shell, earthworms, or chewing insects, as they can damage
                the trap. Also, do not feed it with sausages or meat, as this can cause rot inside the trap. During the entire
                growing season, the plant should be fed 2 or 3 small spiders, flies, or mosquitoes. You should not feed the
                plant if:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>it is weak or suffering from a disease;</li>
                <li>it has been grown in overly moist conditions and poor lighting;</li>
                <li>it was recently transplanted or experienced any other stress.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Feeding should be stopped at the end of September and resumed only when spring arrives.</p>

            <p>Despite being an insect-eating plant, the Venus flytrap can also suffer from various pests and diseases.</p>
            <p><b>Main Diseases and Their Treatment:</b></p>

            <p>Fungal Black Spot: Treat with fungicides, reduce humidity, and prevent water stagnation.</p>
            <p>Gray Mold: Remove the affected parts and treat with fungicides.</p>
            <p>Bacterial Infection: Occurs when the trap cannot digest the prey, causing it to rot. Cut off the affected trap and
                spray the plant with fungicides.</p>

            <p><b>Pests and Their Treatment:</b></p>

            <p>Aphids: Wash off with soapy water, then spray with insecticide in aerosol form.</p>
            <p>Spider Mites: Spray with acaricide 3 times, with a 7-day interval between applications.</p>

                 alt="Information about Venus Flytrap">
            <p><b>Some Interesting Facts About the Venus Flytrap:</b></p>
            <p>1. An adult plant reaches no more than 15 centimeters in height.</p>
            <p>2. During flowering, a tall flower stalk appears, bearing an umbrella-like inflorescence of white flowers. In
                its natural habitat, this carnivorous plant grows in soil with very low nitrogen content, so it obtains this
                element from mollusks (especially slugs) and various insects.</p>
            <p>3. The trap contains glands that produce nectar, which attracts prey.</p>
            <p>4. The edge of the trap has 3 trigger hairs. When these hairs are touched by an insect, the trap rapidly closes,
                and the Venus flytrap begins to produce digestive secretions.</p>
            <p>5. The plant can digest its prey in 5–10 days and then reopens the trap. One trap can digest 2–3 insects before
                it dies.</p>
            <p>6. During the spring and summer, room temperature should range from 20 to 30 degrees Celsius, and in winter,
                it can be lowered to 8 degrees.</p>
            <p>7. This plant requires very high humidity levels. Therefore, it is recommended to grow it in a terrarium or
                greenhouse.</p>
            <p>8. The plant needs bright, diffused light. However, it should be exposed to direct sunlight for 4–5 hours each
                day. East or west-facing windows are ideal for growing it. If grown in a terrarium, it will need supplementary
                lighting with special lamps.</p>
            <p>9. The plant should be transplanted in early spring, only if necessary (usually once every 2 or 3 years).</p>
