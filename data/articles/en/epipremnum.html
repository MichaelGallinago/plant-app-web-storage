                    alt="Transplanting">
                <p>Transplant the vine only when necessary, specifically after the root system becomes very cramped in the pot. While the plant is young, it undergoes this procedure every year, but with age, the frequency of transplants reduces to once every 2 or 3 years.</p>
                <p>Transplant the plant in early spring immediately after it begins intensive growth. Typically, this time falls on the first days of April. When choosing a container for planting, remember that it should not be excessively spacious. The old pot should be only about 20 mm smaller than the new one.</p>
                <p>This vine grows best in humus-rich loose substrate with a neutral reaction. If desired, you can purchase a soil mix designed for ornamental foliage plants from a specialized store. First, create a fairly thick drainage layer in the new container, then carefully transplant the plant using the transfer method. To make it easier to remove the plant from the old container, water it abundantly about two hours before transplanting. Place the plant in the middle of the pot, and then carefully fill all existing voids with fresh soil mix. Before transplanting, it is recommended to shorten excessively long shoots.</p>

                    alt="Watering">
                <p>Moisten the soil mix in the container only after its top layer has dried well. Remember that this vine is among those plants that are less harmed by a not-too-prolonged drought than by regular water stagnation in the root system. Due to systematic overwatering of the substrate, the plant can be affected by disease. If there are drops of liquid on the underside of the foliage, it means that there is water stagnation in the soil mix. In this case, you should water the plant less frequently and less abundantly.</p>
                <p>In winter, when heating devices are actively working, the humidity level becomes very low, so the vine will need to be regularly moistened with a spray bottle. Frequent spraying is also necessary for the plant in summer during hot days. Both watering and moistening epipremnum should be done with soft water: filtered, melted, or well-settled (at least 24 hours).</p>

                    alt="Spraying">
                <p>Epipremnum is a tropical vine that requires regular spraying to maintain the health and decorative appearance of its foliage.</p>
                <p><b>Recommendations for spraying epipremnum:</b></p>
                <p>1. Spraying frequency: During the warm season (spring-summer), it is recommended to spray epipremnum daily, especially on hot days. In winter, when heating devices are operating, it is also necessary to maintain humidity around the plant by spraying it 1-2 times a day.</p>
                <p>2. Use only soft, settled water at room temperature. Hard water can leave whitish spots and salt deposits on the leaves, which spoil the decorative appearance of the plant.</p>
                <p>3. Spray the plant in the morning or during the day so that the leaves have time to dry by evening. This helps prevent the development of fungal diseases.</p>
                <p>4. Pay special attention to spraying during the heating season when the air in rooms becomes particularly dry. Insufficient air humidity can lead to drying of leaf tips.</p>
                <p>5. When spraying, try to evenly moisten all the foliage, including the underside of the leaves, where dust often accumulates and pests can settle.</p>
                <p>Alternative methods for increasing humidity for epipremnum:</p>
                <p>• Placing the pot on a tray with moist pebbles or expanded clay (ensuring the bottom of the pot does not touch the water)</p>
                <p>• Using an electric air humidifier near the plant</p>
                <p>• Grouping plants to create a microclimate with increased humidity</p>
                <p>• Periodically giving the plant a warm shower (once every 2-3 weeks)</p>
                <p>The optimal interval between spraying for epipremnum is 1 day. With proper spraying regimen, the plant will have bright, glossy foliage and active growth.</p>

                    alt="Fertilizer">
                <p>Fertilize regularly once every 15 days; a complex mineral fertilizer for vines in liquid form works excellently for this purpose. Feed this evergreen vine during the period from April to September. In the autumn-winter period, the plant is also fertilized, but not as often (no more than once every 30 days).</p>

                    alt="Information">
                <p>Epipremnum is cultivated indoors as an ornamental foliage plant. The fact is that in cultivation, this vine blooms very rarely.</p>
                <p>Variegated varieties need a lot of bright light, while green-leaved ones can grow both in shade and under diffused bright light.</p>
                <p>Normal room temperature is perfect for this plant. Note that drafts can kill the plant.</p>
                <p>If there are operating heating devices in the room, then you need to moisturize the vine's foliage with a spray bottle as often as possible.</p>
