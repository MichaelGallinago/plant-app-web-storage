        <p>The seasons of the year have a significant impact on all types of plants, from houseplants to outdoor plants. Each season brings its own unique conditions that determine the growth, development, and adaptation of plants. Understanding these seasonal changes helps both gardeners and houseplant enthusiasts care for their plants more effectively. In this article, we will explore how each of the four seasons affects plants.</p>

            <summary><h2>Spring</h2></summary>

            <p>Spring is a time of renewal and growth. As the days get longer and temperatures rise, plants begin to develop actively.</p>
            <p><strong>Houseplants:</strong> Many houseplants, such as ficuses, dracaenas, and peace lilies, begin to produce new leaves and shoots during this time. Fertilizer with a high nitrogen content will help support this active growth. Spring is also an ideal time for repotting plants into fresh soil.</p>
            <p><strong>Outdoor plants:</strong> Outdoors, spring is the flowering season for many perennials, such as daffodils and tulips. Gardeners begin planting annual flowers, such as petunias and marigolds, which will provide color during the summer months. It is important to monitor soil conditions and provide plants with enough moisture.</p>

            <p>The summer months are the time of maximum activity for most plants.</p>
            <p><strong>Houseplants:</strong> During this time, houseplants require more water and light. Regular watering and checking soil moisture levels become especially important. Some plants, like orchids, may need protection from direct sunlight, so placing them in partial shade will be optimal.</p>
            <p><strong>Outdoor plants:</strong> In the summer, outdoor plants like tomatoes, cucumbers, and peppers reach their maximum growth and begin to bear fruit. It is important to monitor watering and fertilization to prevent stress from the heat. You should also be alert to pests that can proliferate in warm weather.</p>

            <summary><h2>Autumn</h2></summary>

            <p>With the arrival of autumn, plants begin preparing for the winter period.</p>
            <p><strong>Houseplants:</strong> During this time, it is important to reduce watering, as most houseplants slow down their growth. Fertilization should also be reduced to avoid overfeeding. If plants have been outdoors, autumn is the time to bring them inside and provide them with good lighting.</p>
            <p><strong>Outdoor plants:</strong> Autumn is harvest time for gardeners. Many vegetables, such as pumpkins and carrots, reach maturity. Leaves of trees, such as maples and oaks, begin to change color and fall off, allowing the plants to conserve moisture and nutrients.</p>

            <summary><h2>Winter</h2></summary>
            <img src="https://orchidea-shop.ru/base/data/2612mid.jpg" alt="Winter">
            <p>In winter, plants are in a dormant state, and their needs change.</p>
            <p><strong>Houseplants:</strong> During this time, it is important to maintain moderate conditions. Most houseplants prefer temperatures around 15-20Â°C. Humidity becomes critically important, as heating systems can dry the air. Regular misting and using humidifiers will help keep plants healthy.</p>
            <p><strong>Outdoor plants:</strong> In winter, outdoor plants, especially perennials, may be exposed to cold. Some plants, like conifers, retain their needles and continue to grow, while others, like bulbs, begin preparing for spring flowering, sheltering in the ground.</p>
