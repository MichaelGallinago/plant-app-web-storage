        <p>Houseplants need fertilizers at each stage of development. A lack of nutrients can negatively affect flowering, growth, and the overall appearance of the plants. You can find various complex fertilizers in flower shops. However, high-quality fertilizers can also be made at home using readily available materials.</p>

                 alt="Feeding houseplants">
            <p>Timely application of fertilizers to potted houseplants is the key to proper development, healthy growth, and abundant flowering. The reason is that the potting mix in a flower pot contains only a limited supply of specific nutrients, which depletes over time. If the plants are not fed at least twice a month, they will begin to starve. This will inevitably lead to a decline in the plant’s decorative appeal.</p>
            <p>You can make your own nutrient mix at home, using various organic waste such as eggshells, onion skins, coffee grounds, banana peels, aquarium water, used tea, etc. Fertilizers made from organic materials actively enrich the substrate with beneficial nutrients, help disinfect it, and promote the colonization of useful microorganisms.</p>

            </summary>
            <p>Spring is the time for the awakening of all plants, and houseplants are no exception. During this time, their growth accelerates, and buds start to appear. Therefore, spring is when plants especially need feeding. Feed them once every 2–3 weeks until the bush begins to bloom. At the beginning of spring, plants need feedings with a high nitrogen content. Just before flowering, their need for potassium and phosphorus increases.</p>
            <p>Note! Liquid nutrients should not be applied to dry soil. Be sure to water the plants well before feeding.</p>

            </summary>
            <p>In summer, flowers also need regular feeding, as they expend a lot of nutrients and energy on blooming. During this time, they especially need potassium. It is recommended to feed them twice a month.</p>
            <p>When performing foliar feeding, avoid letting the nutrient solution come into contact with the flowers. This can lead to the formation of brownish spots, which reduces the decorative appeal of the flowers.</p>

            <p>As autumn arrives, it is recommended to significantly reduce the amount of watering and frequency of feeding. Otherwise, the flowers will not be able to properly prepare for the dormant period. In autumn, houseplants especially need phosphorus.</p>
            <p>Feedings should be done once every 4 weeks, and the summer dosage should be reduced by half. However, there is an exception to this rule — houseplants that bloom in the autumn. In this case, the feeding schedule should remain the same as in summer. Specialists recommend using granular fertilizers at this time, which have a prolonged effect.</p>

            <p>During the cold winter months, almost all houseplants are in a dormant state. During this time, they should be kept cool. At this time, the plants not only rest but also form buds.</p>
            <p>Feeding is not done during this period, and watering is also reduced. However, there is an exception — plants that bloom in winter. These plants should be fed once every 15 days with fertilizers that contain phosphorus and potassium.</p>

            <p>Almost all houseplants love sugar. It contains only glucose and fructose. Glucose gives the plant a burst of energy and ensures better absorption of organic compounds. However, for glucose to be well absorbed, an optimal amount of carbon dioxide is necessary. If there is not enough of this element in the substrate, the feeding can lead to mold formation.</p>
            <p>To prevent this, it is recommended to use EM preparations. Specialists advise using pharmaceutical glucose or lump sugar for feeding. For every liter of water, one glucose tablet or one lump of sugar is used. Such feedings should not be done more than once every 30 days.</p>

            <img src="https://rastenievod.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/7-71.jpg" alt="Yeast">
            <p>Yeast is quite popular in indoor gardening. This is because it contains many hormones involved in regulating cell division. Yeast is also rich in thiamine, B vitamins, and auxin.</p>

            <p>Thanks to yeast, the process of mineralizing organic matter occurs much faster. It also helps produce essential macroelements and improves the activity of beneficial microorganisms in the soil mix. The composition of yeast is very similar to that of complex mineral fertilizers.</p>
            <p>To prepare the nutrient solution, dissolve 1 gram of yeast and 1.5 tablespoons of sugar in half a liter of warm water. Feedings should be done no more than once every four weeks. The fertilizer can be used for both decorative-leaved and flowering plants.</p>

            <p>Plants can also be fed with used tea leaves, which should first be thoroughly dried. It has a pronounced nutritional effect and helps improve the structure of the soil mix. Typically, dried tea is mixed into the soil, or it can be added to the new container during repotting. The dry used tea should constitute no more than a third of the total amount of substrate.</p>
            <p>House violets particularly love tea leaf feedings. After such treatments, the buds form much faster, and the flowering duration is increased. In addition, the used tea can be used as mulch on the surface of the soil in the pot, which slows down water evaporation.</p>

            <p>To treat a plant affected by chlorosis, mix 2 liters of water, 50 ascorbic acid tablets, and ½ teaspoon of copper sulfate. The solution should be diluted with water in a 1:5 ratio. Use this solution regularly every 8-12 days.</p>

            <p>Potassium permanganate contains a large amount of manganese and potassium, which are essential for the proper development and healthy growth of houseplants. However, potassium permanganate can acidify the soil, so it is mostly used in nutrient mixtures for begonias, hydrangeas, and tradescantias.</p>
            <p>This solution has strong disinfectant properties and is also used to fight pests. There is no specific dosage when preparing the nutrient solution. The concentration depends on the plant species, its condition, and the deficiency of active micro- and macro-elements. The universal solution has a pinkish color and is used once every 30 days.</p>
