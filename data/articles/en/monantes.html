            <p><b>Step-by-step guide for transplanting Monanthes:</b></p>
            <p>1. Prepare the soil: It should be loose and light, with a large amount of coarse sand. To prepare the soil mixture, combine leaf soil, sand, and small pieces of charcoal.</p>
            <p>2. Choose a container: A shallow and wide container is suitable for Monanthes. A good drainage layer should be made at the bottom of the pot.</p>
            <p>3. Water the plant: A few hours before transplanting, water the Monanthes to moisten the soil.</p>
            <p>4. Carefully remove the plant from the pot: Tilt the pot and gently tap to break the root ball. Then carefully remove the plant from the pot without damaging the roots.</p>
            <p>5. Place the plant in the hole. It should be dug to the depth of the root ball and twice as wide. Carefully place the plant in the hole so that the root ball is level with the surrounding soil surface.</p>
            <p>6. Cover the hole with native soil to ensure the plant is securely fixed.</p>
            <p>7. Water: Thoroughly water the plant immediately after planting, ensuring the soil is well soaked.</p>
            <p>8. Mulch: Place organic mulch around the plant, leaving some space around the stem to prevent it from rotting.</p>
            <p>Transplant Monanthes as needed when the rosettes grow to the point that they no longer fit in the pot. This procedure is usually carried out in the spring every two to three years.</p>

                <h2>When to Water Monanthes</h2>
            </summary>
            <img src="https://fluxai.pro/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffal.media%2Ffiles%2Frabbit%2F8KQd_BWSAgqPQPJBmoVeq_image.webp&w=1920&q=75"
                 alt="Watering Monanthes">
            <p>During active growth (spring and summer), water Monanthes moderately but regularly. Wait until the soil in the pot dries out not only on the surface but preferably all the way to the bottom.</p>
            <p>During the dormant period (autumn and winter), gradually reduce watering, ensuring that the leaves do not start to fall and wilt.</p>
            <p>Water the plant with room temperature water. Overwatering can lead to rot, causing leaves to fall off and stems to turn black.</p>

                 alt="Fertilizing Monanthes">
            <p>Use regular cactus fertilizers for Monanthes. Apply fertilizer 1–2 times during active growth, reducing the manufacturer's recommended concentration by half.</p>
            <p>Bona Forte series "Beauty" fertilizer is also suitable for Monanthes. It contains a complete complex of nutrients necessary for full and balanced plant nutrition. Apply fertilizer from March to October once a week, and from November to February — once a month. For root feeding, dilute 5 ml of fertilizer in 1.5 liters of water.</p>
            <p>Special fertilizers for succulents can also be used, applying them 1–2 times during active growth, reducing the manufacturer's recommended concentration by half.</p>

            <p><b>Some diseases and pests of Monanthes and their treatments:</b></p>
            <p>• Mealybug: Sticky white cottony mass appears on stems and in leaf axils, plant growth stops. Remove pests with a stick, wash the infested areas with alcohol, and rinse with water. Severely damaged plants are treated with chemicals or destroyed.</p>
            <p>• Spider mite: Leaves turn yellow, and delicate webs appear on stems. Wash pests off with water, covering the potting soil with plastic beforehand, or treat the plant with chemical solutions.</p>
            <p>• Wilted leaves: Can be treated by ensuring proper watering, providing shade during the hottest part of the day, using fungicidal sprays, or applying bactericides if bacterial infections are identified.</p>
