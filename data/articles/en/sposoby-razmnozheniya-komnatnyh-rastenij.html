    <h1>Methods of Propagating Houseplants</h1>
    <div class="section" id="0">
        <p>Do you want to increase the number of your houseplants without spending a penny?
            Or grow a beautiful flower to present as a gift? Or perhaps you want to replace an old
            plant with a young one? Propagating houseplants can help in all these cases. Additionally,
            gardening is a wonderful way to entertain your child and teach them useful skills.</p>
        <p>Nowadays, most houseplants are purchased from specialized stores, but it can often be much
            more satisfying to admire a beautiful flower that you grew yourself. Many people think that
            propagating houseplants only involves taking a leaf and placing it in a glass of water to root.
            But this is far from the case. There are many different methods that allow you to do this.</p>

            <summary><h2>Propagating Houseplants by Cuttings</h2></summary>
            <p>Propagation by cuttings (a vegetative method) is the most popular among gardeners. A cutting is
                a part of the plant that is cut off deliberately. It has the ability to form roots and grow. In
                horticulture, several types of cuttings are distinguished: stem, leaf, tip, and mid-cuttings.</p>

            <summary><h2>Propagation by Tip Cuttings</h2></summary>
            <img src="https://rastenievod.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2-10.jpg" alt="Propagation by Tip Cuttings">
            <p>This method is used for all trailing plants, as well as for touch-me-not and balsam.</p>
            <p>To obtain a tip cutting, a part of a non-woody stem at the top is cut off. The cutting should
                have developed leaves, ranging from 2 to 4. Make the cut about a centimeter below the node, as
                roots appear first at this node. To speed up rooting, it's recommended to treat the cut with
                growth-stimulating substances (phytohormones).</p>
            <p>The cutting is then planted in a soil mixture for young plants and watered. To maintain humidity
                at a high level, cover the container with plastic.</p>

            <summary><h2>Propagation by Stem Cuttings</h2></summary>
            <img src="https://rastenievod.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/3-8.jpg" alt="Propagation by Stem Cuttings">
            <p>You can propagate ficus, geraniums, all succulent plants, and cacti by stem cuttings.</p>
            <p>This type of cutting can only be taken from a healthy plant, and the cut should be made slightly
                below the node. The cutting should consist of 3 or 4 nodes and should have leaves. The cut should
                be fresh and even. There should be no flowers or buds on the cutting. If desired, you can remove
                the leaves from the lower part. Rooting is done in moist soil, containing a lot of sand, or in a
                soil mixture for young plants. After roots appear (approximately 3â€“4 weeks), transplant the
                plant into regular soil. Most cuttings root just by placing them in a glass of water.</p>
            <p>If you are propagating succulents or cacti this way, the cutting should be left to air-dry for
                a few days before planting it for rooting. The cut area should become sealed, and the edges
                should curl inward. This will prevent stem rot. After planting, lightly mist the soil with a
                spray bottle (do not water).</p>
            <p>Cuttings of geraniums and succulents should not be covered with plastic during rooting. Other
                plants, however, need high humidity during this period, so they should be covered with plastic.</p>
            <p>It is generally recommended to place the cuttings in a well-lit and sufficiently warm location,
                but they should be protected from direct sunlight.</p>
            <p>Typically, cuttings are propagated in the spring and summer when the plant is growing actively.
                However, some plants, such as geraniums and fuchsias, are best propagated in the late summer days.</p>
            <p>Mid-cuttings are a part of the stem cutting. They are taken from the middle or lower part of the
                shoot. These are usually used for propagating tradescantia.</p>

            <summary><h2>Propagation by Leaf Cuttings</h2></summary>
            <img src="https://rastenievod.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/4-7.jpg" alt="Propagation by Leaf Cuttings">
            <p>Leaf cuttings can be used to propagate bushy begonias, gloxinias, African violets (Saintpaulias),
                and peperomias.</p>
            <p>To propagate an African violet, take a healthy, strong leaf with a stem of adequate length, cut
                it from the plant, and plant it in a special soil mixture. Once the new plantlets form on the leaf,
                they need to be separated and planted individually.</p>
            <p>Succulent plants are propagated directly by leaf cuttings. For example, to propagate streptocarpus,
                sansevieria, and gloxinia, use a part of the leaf. Plant the leaf so that only a small part of
                it sticks out above the soil surface. If the leaf pieces are too small, place them on the surface
                and gently press them into the substrate.</p>

            <summary><h2>Propagation by Layering</h2></summary>
            <img src="https://rastenievod.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/5-7.jpg" alt="Propagation by Layering">

            <p>Layering can be used to propagate trailing or ampullary plants with long shoots, such as ivy,
                chlorophytum, and others.</p>
            <p>This method of propagation is unique because the new plant forms while still attached to the
                parent plant.</p>
            <p>Once shoots on the long stems begin to form, they are secured to the surface of a special soil
                mixture with wire or a pin. Rooting occurs fairly quickly. The new plant can be separated when
                it forms a root system and begins to grow.</p>

            <summary><h2>Propagation by Offshoots</h2></summary>
            <img src="https://rastenievod.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/6-8.jpg" alt="Propagation by Offshoots">
            <p>An offshoot is a new plant that develops at the base of the parent plant. After the offshoots
                develop well, they are separated from the parent plant with a sharp knife or by hand, trying
                to make the cut close to the main flower. It is important to ensure that the offshoot has
                plenty of its own roots. The offshoot is then planted in an individual pot and cared for
                similarly to cuttings.</p>
            <p>On the parent bulbous plant, small bulbs appear. These should be carefully separated and planted
                in separate containers. They will typically bloom after 1 or 2 years.</p>

            <p>You can propagate Degremona, Kalanchoe, Bryophyllum Degremona, and Kalanchoe Tubiflora.</p>
            <p>Usually, plantlets with their own roots develop at the tips of the leaves of these plants. They
                are carefully detached with fingers, being careful not to damage the delicate roots. They are
                planted in containers filled with moist soil mixture. When the flowers grow, they should be
                repotted into individual pots.</p>

            <img src="https://rastenievod.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/8-5.jpg" alt="Propagation by Runners">
            <p>Runners can be used to propagate Episcia, trailing Saxifrage, Chlorophytum, and Tradescantia.</p>
            <p>Runners are long shoots that extend along the ground or other surfaces. They form small plants
                at the nodes. Once the new plantlets are formed, they are separated from the parent plant and
                planted in their own pots.</p>

            <p>Now you have learned about various methods of propagating houseplants. The key to success is
                selecting the right propagation method based on the plant species, maintaining the right
                conditions for root formation, and patiently caring for your cuttings or offshoots until they
                establish themselves as independent plants.</p>
            <p>Good luck with your indoor garden!</p>
